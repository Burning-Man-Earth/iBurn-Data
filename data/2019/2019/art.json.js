Inspired by the incidents we witnessed at our installation and the vandalism we heard about from other artists, we realized we needed to be teachers ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe will do \"pop up\" performances out and about, with most of our programming taking place on buses or art cars. With a \"learning is fun\" mindset, we'll use quizzes, reenactments and songs to impart tips and tricks designed to embed the principles into your very soul.",

It is a reminder to both not take ourselves too seriously and also to ALWAYS look around us \u2014 you never know what you may miss if you don't. The hand-painted letters B-O-R-I-N-G are fabricated from reclaimed sheet metal and discarded retail sign parts, and lit by 300 ten-watt incandescent bulbs and securely attached to a welded base with wheels. BRC citizens interact with the piece by creating a moveable, groovable dance party with us as we roll the sign from art piece to art piece, burn to burn.",

The head rests in repose while its left hand claws at its mind fighting to reveal a crystalline stained glass structure akin to the \"Space Whale\" inside.\r\n\r\nA series of hidden doors in the mouth, wrists and head open into a four story, 18 room maze. Each modular room creates a unique space dedicated to the nature of our minds, our struggles with being and the weird and fanciful process of dreaming.",

Linearity also reflects the passage of life; all lives have a beginning, a middle and an end which metaphorically is included in this temple's form. Following this metaphor a variety of spaces are created; narrow spaces and wide spaces, dark spaces and bright spaces. Tunnels  create intimate experiences with shade.. A large central hall expands in width and height providing a bright area suitable for gatherings.",

They have gathered thousands of Dirty Secrets and are always a cool place to sit and chill.\r\n\r\nTDS will be an 9\"x9\"x58\" pedestal much like a mailbox. It will be made from high grade quality hardwoods, and finished with a smooth dust free surface. A tray will fold down from the front and reveal a writing surface, pens, and Dirty Secret Cards. On the top there will be a slot to drop in the card. It will be small, quaint and beautifully interesting.\r\n\r\nEveryone has a secret, this will be the place to write them down and release them.",

Although it has enabled innovation and permeated human culture around the world, the consequences of using this seemingly magical material without due diligence are becoming clear.",

You let go of the button and your fresh beat continues on loop. Your friends each take a turn and together you make a joyous cacophony of silliness! \r\n\r\nBurning Man shifts the paradigm of art from a commodified object of consumption to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. Everyone loves music, but many people have never experienced the joy of making music. This piece illustrates how easy and fun that process can be.",

After all, the \"oil god\", charging all he offers, can be replaced by an older, benevolent god, the Sun.\r\n\r\nIt is urgent to be \"freaky\", yes, and fear not the ignorance or darkness we live today. The Compass Rose illuminates Love, and only empathy Shines against fear and defeats walls or borders.\r\n\r\nThe Burner, pedaling the Rose, generates new forces, destroying the dogma of a single and polluting North. Ridding the rose we dream about alternatives. We gently believe that in Art, there will never be aesthetic without an ethic.",

This alchemy will take place as an interactive ritual theater open for all citizens to engage with. It's set in a hexagonal Temple to the Divine Feminine and the bee, with fabric and LED woven walls, interactive altars and artwork. Dusk and dawn oracles offer truths to all who sit before them. This is an experiment of the imagination to explore how deeply one can dare to believe and how our belief creates reality. Imagine and Bee Divine.",

        "description": "\"Why People Can't Fly\" is a work that I feel represents myself. I, much like most of us, have baggage, problems and worries that drag me down. Because of this baggage, I feel like I can't fly, metaphorically. I'm being pulled down by my obligations and my inner immaturity.\r\n\r\nI know I'm not the only one with these issues. Each of us has baggage that weighs on us. Whether it's financial, familial or personal, these problems are at the base of each of our lives. We as a species and individually cannot grow unless we change, we cannot fly without it.\r\n\r\nSeven sins underly these problems. These are our own, personal sins and the sins of those people on whom we rely and depend.",

My personal perspective is that we are all here for the enjoyment of everyone else and creative dress is a part of that. Printing out life-size images gives the full effect of what it looks like and feels like to capture these people in that moment. After all, WE ARE Burning Man !",

Participants will think about and relate to the messages put forth.\r\nAt night the display shows beautiful LED animations across all TVs as if the TVs together represent a single large screen. As a participant approaches the installation, the participant's moving image silhouette will be super-imposed upon the animations and displayed across the wall.\r\n#TheTVs",

Primarily of wood construction, the sculpture will stand ~20 ft tall and consist of several interactive elements (such as a rotating hourglass) that invite visitors to engage with questions about time. A fully functional sundial by day will evoke thoughts of ancient time keeping. At night it will transform to a digital timepiece and be illuminated by thousands of LEDs. The sculpture will be burned in place as a testament to the fleeting nature of time.",

The swing itself generates feelings of nostalgia and simplicity. \n\nWhile the swings remain unoccupied, the cloud above emanates a steady white glow of light, appearing to float within the darkness. The light shines downward highlighting the empty swing in an invitation for passersby to enjoy its delights. Once the swing is occupied the transformation and color begins to glow. Cloud Swing explores the transformative possibilities of imagination and innovation. Showcasing that no matter what pulls you back wonder, delight, and joy will inevitably push you forward.",

Beckoning from across the playa, a circle of banners dyed along the color wheel creates a kinetic silken environment and provides ever-changing views of the city from a dynamic interior. \n\nIn the center is the Prism, a triangular tower with a sound installation using noise-reducing technology to create a sanctuary of quiet. Benches provide places to gather, rest, and commune with other Burners.\n\nAt night, the spectrum of color expands. Images are rear-projected onto a band of acrylic panels at the top of the Prism, color-changing lighting bathes the banners, and ambient light glows around seating.",

Time, in this piece, is a paradox and an illusion as it combines the future and the past, simultaneously presenting a quantitative measuring system with a qualitative one.\n\nThe concept illustrates how motion and time change according to our perceptions. It represents the evolution of time management and our obsession with the passage of time. It suggests to the observer that all matter may shrink into a tiny dot again, which will end the concept of time as we know it. This sculpture is to discover ways to distort time, exaggerate perceptions or to embellish the estimation of time, all within the shifting sands of playa time.",

Each cube as well as the window in the central monolith contain a human head in a state of metamorphosis.  Two microphones fitted with voice synthesizers are placed below the window on either side of the monolith.

And the structure doubles as a giant shade structure, where people can push through the stepped skin to shaded terraces at the rear, or shelter beneath them.",

We also need to expand out and see beyond ourselves; to connect with our tribe. So we come to understand that to change the smallest part is to change the nature of the whole. Finding the balance between the two is where we find the courage to set ourselves free, to be who we've always felt we are. \r\n\r\nSimultaneously singular & infinite; separate & connected. \r\n\r\nWhat will you see through your lens?",

A pauper's ballroom. \r\n\r\nThe piece is a grand staircase with no second floor, framed by four towers. The way to the ballroom is to climb the staircase, turn around and then descend. The ballroom is the playa but best appreciated through the descent of a staircase, giving you the trappings of grandeur, while being merely pretense to the actual beauty of the free, natural space of the playa. \r\n\r\n\"Nothing\" is the absence of substance. It is the void, the infinite unknown. In this way, the \"Stairway to Nothing\" is the \"Stairway to the Void.\"\r\n\r\nOr it's just the \"Stairway to the Playa's Second Floor.\"",

The cone shell certainly has a life of its own, yet this life is also directly derived from the participants input inside, thus crossing the borders between sound and visual shape and the new field of algorithmic generated music and the most essential instrument of mankind - the human voice.",

I am a professional therapist by training and whether they get professional advice or very nonprofessional suggestions will be contingent on their issues.  During the times that I am not there, this bench can be used as a buddy bench.  If someone sees another sitting on the bench, it is an opportunity to take a seat and make a friend.  You never know who you will run into or connect with on the playa and this will be a constructive way to facilitate  this encounter.",

Genie is embedded in our consciousness as a creative, intelligent, mythological, guardian spirit. His role is to make dreams come true allowing something to happen that can't be stopped. At the base of the genie's feet is a giant Book of Wishes. Participants use this to write out their dreams. Its a place to acknowledge wishes as affirmations of how we imagine our best selves into being. Genie allows us to have no restrictions on our requests. Dreams are not just your own, they are connected with everyone else. It's about nuances of communication. My hope is that participants will connect with Genie to affirm their best selves into being.",

The front and back sides are laser cut into puzzle piece shapes. Riddles are laser cut on both of the sides. Light escapes the cuts and is diffused by plexiglass. \n\nAlthough the sculpture is meant to be visually appealing, the message of the installation is that life is simple and complicated, it is peaceful and frustrating and it is beautiful and finite. \n\nThe sculpture reminds us that time is precious and that each of us has our own beautiful puzzle to solve. We can try to solve it alone or with others. We can enjoy the journey or focus only on the destination. How we attempt solve the puzzle is more important that the solution itself.",

Fascination gives wanderers of the playa the opportunity to engage with it passively (by watching its magic effect from afar) or actively (by using their own muscles to power the illusion for others). Some may choose to try out both of these modes of engagement thereby switching between the roles of the magician (the illusion-maker or fascinator) and the spectator (the perceiver or the one fascinated).",

This juxtaposition between the nostalgic and sinister has become a hallmark of my body of work\u2014in presenting attractive images that viewers initially feel safe absorbing, I cleverly and strategically encourage them to examine their own critique of their feelings and emotions related to present day culture along with the principles of Black Rock City.",

Radical inclusion is not poorly defined gender stereotypes and artificial visions that upset the moral arc of the universe bending towards realistic body shapes and non-binary gender roles. Barbie is a plastic aesthetic that degrades the Burning Man culture with a false identity and unrealistic proportions.\n\nIf we love ourselves, honor those that create love and not what defines eating disorders. If we must pretend to be others, at least let it be a revolutionary countercultural visionary. \n\nThen, like all great Burning Man art pieces, climb inside, learn about Larry, take a selfie and depart for other shiny sparkly things.",

Burners are invited to explore the concept of forgiveness through awareness and confession. Heed the florescent and mirrored road signs surrounding the booth as you are reminded to Forgive yourself. Indulge in a daily dose of truth and humor as the message on the marquee board changes daily.

She strives to open the possibility of using the sky as a 3-dimensional medium for art. In nature, water creatures live in a place physically below that of terrestrial humans, and they have been downstream of many harmful human activities. SkyWhale aims to show that there can be progress and she can help heal and transform the human relationship with Nature. In recognition of the metamorphosis theme, the SkyWhale will embody the transformation of a sea creature to dream that takes to the air.",

Can our fleeting actions ultimately stack up to monumental outcomes?\r\n\r\nThe piece, built by first-time playa artists, consists of a 26 ft spire, with ornate star-patterned walls. It shines like a Moroccan lantern at night, and beckons viewers to rest in a plush interior, seek shade, duck a windstorm. It incubates change. People come to reflect on their course, and to feel inspired to set their sights higher.",

        "description": "Therolin is a Theremin but instead of playing from a speaker the instrument is a very large guitar string electronically strummed, using an 8 inch X 20 ft pipe as a resonating body. The large pipe juts up from the playa at a very low angle. It ends at eye height. Below it's opening a small podium awaits.  As the participant reaches out to touch the podium, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound in lieu of the traditional synthesized sound.",

There are no signs telling you what to do, however, this is an art project that requires participation in order to understand the piece. \r\n  \r\nThis piece is meant to be functional art. Some of the things our projects is meant to provide include but are nor limited to: shade from the sun, shelter from the dust, a place for people to gather and communicate, a place to rest, a place for sound reduction, a meeting point, or a landmark. \r\n\r\nThis project was our gift to the participants of Burning Man DaVinci's Workshop in 2016. It is given as a small token of our appreciation for all the fantastic people and their wonderful creations that we have shared.",

It will be exciting to see citizens of Black Rock City experience the rush (and heat!) of one's own heartbeat pulsing through and with the Fire of the Phoenix! Because humans feel the need to destroy that which is old to reemerge anew through the Mythos of the Phoenix, it is dedicated to the many souls who no longer walk among us.",

Actually, if goes as planned, this current MVP will be replaced with a real time-travel booth. \n\nThis is in fact also a place-holder. When ready, our fully functional time-travel booth will be sent here on 08/31 at 5 pm. Please meet us next to the booth at this time (not too close just in case).",

Precisely balanced and using stainless steel ball bearings, the piece will react to gentlest of breezes yet withstand the most intense winds. At the very top sits the sun, made of a stainless steel sphere surrounded by rusted steel flames. This piece gives the illusion of the heat generated by upward-moving flames rising to activate the sculpture. The randomness of flame heat is reflected in the randomness of the sculpture's movement.",

The sacrum (= 'holy bone') is the first gateway through which we metamorphize from space to substance, into the wordly realm. It is also the last bone that disintegrates, holding ritual significance in ancient cultures, as a reminder of the past and future passage that we all share. Sacra's focal point is a 'sacral object', embedded with convex mirrors reflecting our shared cellular origins; a bowed gate like a funnel for source into form;  a silhouette echoing Japanese torii gates, which traditionally indicate a passage between the profane/worldly plane to the sacred. \"Sacra\" mirrors that journey, literally and poetically, in reverse and also 'in between'.",

These connections allow us to remember the limitless powers of the human heart and is a catalyst for transformations.",

The initial appearance is a bright white light at the end of the tunnel and an entrance into the heavenly light-filled center. In the center, the room is immersed in a brilliant white light. Upon exit, a side door opens to yet another layer, with an immensely expansive celestial wonderland surrounded by the cosmos.",

        "description": "Magnetic Waltz is a freestanding retrofuturist structure cradling a large white circular glass viewing portal approximately 3 feet in diameter. Magnetic liquid dances and twirls in the portal, choreographed via hidden electronically-controlled magnets. The black fluid provides a clean, crisp contrast against the white glass background. Unlike electronic displays or LEDs, the fluid exhibits subtle three-dimensionality, reflecting sunlight off the surfaces of the liquid in interesting ways. It is physical and real, yet completely magical at the same time. The display showcases several interesting physics: magnetic force and magnetization, fluid mechanics, surface tension and gravity.",

The viewer can experience a multiplicity of meanings, depending on what goes on inside their own heads. Some may prefer looking at an object, while others like looking through the object. Maybe everyone lives in different realities. Talking Heads can show the power of imagination to lead us into a metaphysical and magical experience of metamorphosis.",

This is the chance for participants to ask those questions and more of the people that have done it and know what to do.\r\n\r\nThe show will move around the inner playa to various locations for 4 days over the course of the week. Locations can be near esplanade, the keyholes, major art pieces or camps. The intent is to add diversity to the city and reach different areas of the city by rotating the locations on each of the 4 days of the event the show will be held on.",

Each is decorated uniquely to represent the artist's vision of Divine, Feminine, Warrior and Goddess. The torsos act as \"guards\" to the Pyramid, which contains a raised Throne in the center. In keeping with the metamorphosis theme, it asks the viewer to sit on the Throne and reflect on how they have grown and evolved to empower and express these traits of DFWG within themselves. The Throne is facing westward in alignment with a view of the Man, the mountains and the setting sun. It is designed to help facilitate the participant to embrace her self-worth and reclaim her power as the Goddess she is.",

The farthest point at BRC, Point 3, once again is  their beautiful wide open home. Literally on the  green fence stakes you will perchance upon almost 100 STARZ of all kinds. They are creatively concocted by 25 different people from ages 3 to 75. Each star tells a story, some are head scratchers, all are quirky. They are created with almost 100% recycled objects, repurposed items from yard sales or found objects. Your ride along the fence will most certainly be rewarded with unexpected folk art that puts a smile on your face. Discover the sounds and the open vistas the deep playa offer. Wish upon one because as we all know the playa provides.",

After the Tohoku earthquake, this disconnected telephone became a touchstone and a conduit of grief. Our phone booth structure is inspired by traditional Japanese Shoji screens and resembles a large Japanese lantern. Inside is an old telephone with a voicemail system that will record any story participants wish to share. The intention is to create a private, tranquil space for folks to talk with someone or something they miss and record their story if they choose. There is also an option to listen to messages left by others. Grief is a powerful metamorphic force and the Dust Phone seeks to hold the stories of that change.",

Much of the heteronormative default world expects to find their match in life. In contrast, for furries (and many non-default peoples), we grew up with a feeling of being perennial outsiders in our own society. So finding an anthropomorphic mate who shares your life and world is an amazing surprise and fulfilling journey. Three 6 ft tall anthropomorphic SFW furry characters (called \"fursonas\") are illustrated are scattered on the Playa, and each has a mate (or mates) back at Camp Fur (at 7:30 and Echo). Each piece has a plaque with the artist and title, a description of the fursona character, their Journey, and something about their mate.\n\nCan you find the mates for each of the three mated sets?",

The numbers are lit in a marquee style, along with colored lights lighting up the box from the inside. The numbers are stained in a dark stain so that it contrasts the playa dust. The box is a place to sit by the numbers, look out on the playa, reflect on their significance. \n\nThis art piece represents sexual equality. No matter how you identify or your sexual preference, this position is universal amongst all humans. It's an equal exchange of power and celebrates the rare occasion of giving and receiving at the same time. \n\nInteractivity: participants can interact with the project by leaving us a note on the box. The box is unfinished wood and we will leave markers/pencils out for these notes. We invite participants to write a note sharing their personal story related to 69.",

        "description": "Space Saver On The Playa is a wooden transformative piece of furniture. Designed in the 18th century it is an ironing board, step stool and chair. This 3 in 1 multi purpose furniture was made for the single man to maintain a proper home. Thus it is called \"The Bachelor Chair.\" It is believed to have been invented by Thomas Jefferson.  \nEasy instructions for tilting and altering the piece and props for role play will be in a small suitcase lay flat and secure next to the \"chair\".\nSome of the props include Vintage American Dream Irons to iron out your differences. Aprons to don and clothes on the padded iron board.\nNext it is a step stool to view the heavens with a star guide. Star with a Brownie Starflash camera.\nNow it is a chair for the  contemplative one with several books to ponder...Keroucs Desolation Angels, On The Road and a History of Man.\nA small oddity on the playa.",

These interconnected pieces explore and evoke the universal human experiences of bittersweet change, loss, conflict, and resolution. There are 5 performers, making up a series of acts, on a combination of aerial apparatus including silks, lyra (hoop), slings, rope and chains. \n\nThe piece explores themes of transformation in both positive and negative directions. We can change others for the better without seeing immediate change in ourselves. New perspective can make us leave or drive us to return. We take the lessons of a new location and new interactions and apply them back home, the same way we take the lessons and perspective of the desert back into the default world. We are transformed both by conflict and by cooperation.",

It was built to embody the universe, sun, and the rays that it emits, all the way down to the flowers they nourish. It sits behind the Artist as a supporting act, illuminating the more spiritual side of the music we all love. When designing it, the Notre Dame was ablaze with fire, and I thought to turn the sadness of that catastrophe, into something beautiful. Its lines were borrowed from the famous Rose Sud that sits above the entrance. Whenever the Mandala is present it's meant to create a more sacred space and radiate splendid emotion.",

This year BRC is home to a new civic experience - a polling place in which Burners vote for Mayor of BRC. However, it is 2019 and every important election these days experiences interference so why would anyone expect the BRC election to be different? \nBurners find the polling place during day and night by the \"Vote Here\" flag and \"Elections Fucking Matter\" neon sign. The voter enters and casts their ballot using the two electronic polling booths. However, midway through voting an incoming information operation seeks to influence the Burner's vote. Since Burners believe in radical self reliance we allow the Burner to choose who they want to influence their vote: a foreign country, social media, dark money, etc. Once the Burner has had their vote influenced they vote and pick up a custom \"I voted today\" sticker on their way out of the polling place.",

This act demonstrates and illustrates change and transformation, from slow moving compassionate movements, to dynamic transitions that are in sync, but also asynchronous. Our troupe came together exactly in this manner, we've all come from different walks of life, different circus experiences, but found commonality in the passion we have, and the passion we have for sharing, teaching, learning and collaborating with one another. The duo lyra is the first piece we've worked on together, and like us, it has also transformed and grown over the years. We'd love to perform this at Burning Man and share our passion for the community.",

Under each piece is a bench back to sit and lean against. Within this six sided circular structure there is no beginning or end. The wind speaks to those who will listen via the structure. Resonating chambers, strings, and chimes bathe the environment in sound illustrating the interconnected nature of the universe via the principles of sympathetic resonance and kinetic motion. Night views include a subtle changing lightscape that casts colorful shadows on the playa.",

Two pieces anchor the exhibit. One: an Aeolean harp, a 14ft tall string instrument based on a concept of ancient Greece and built around a trampoline salvaged from a destroyed family home. Two: a wooden windmill, 12ft tall rigged to chime via wind motion. An adjunct is a canon causing a gong to strike semi-randomly. Smaller sound and wind-active devices are hosted within the circle of the exhibit.",

Using our antennas (2), we are able to deliver data commands (think color commands for LED wall, AR commands for AR cameras) to any cube of air we want to in 3D with 6x6x6 inch precision. We want to use our two antennas to create two interactive experiences of discovery that foster an understanding of how technology and our physical space is rapidly altering how we move about and why. The art installation named Interlife is a seed entrance to a new spatial/wave:particle world. Out of the cave and into the sunlight at night. Interlife is the true world that will showcase the two experiences listed for burners to touch the seed.",

The bass will have 4 steel strings and possibly some form of amplification. We are planning to have a hand crank or a wind power crank to strum and pluck the strings. There will be metal tines from an agricultural hay rake on the back and sides of the bass that will become a kalimba or thumb piano. These will be played either by hand or with wooden drum sticks and add musical depth and sound.",

Rather than resting on legs, the sides extend all the way to the ground, creating a useful storage and service area underneath. The plywood skin is coated in hand painted graphics, reflecting an earlier era in pinball history with a steampunk flare. In keeping with the steampunk theme, the lights glow in green and yellow tones illuminating brass and copper components beneath a clear polycarbonate surface. Rolling between the bumpers and flippers, a three inch chrome ball puts points on the board where winners are born.",

Tzompantli is a Nahuatl word, the language of the Aztecs, and the largest one was in the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan.  It was 60 by 30 meters, several meters tall, and contained an estimated 60,000 skulls.  \n\nThis BRC tzompantli is a replica of the ancient ones.

        "description": "A Way with Words is an interactive art installation that allows participants to physically manipulate famous quotes into new inspiring phrases.  The sculpture is a small semi-circular space created by six benches on the top of which sits a grid of ceramic blocks that can be spun and configured to align words from the quotes.  A Way with Words celebrates the struggle to accurately remember a favorite quote.  It embraces short term memory loss and encourages new discovery.  The blocks are literally words set in stone, and also an opportunity to re-create an inspiring quote for someone else to remember . . . or forget.",

        "description": "The Achilles Apparatus allows communications with spirits and transdimensional intelligences. Several of the people working on it were or became insane; the mechanism by which it operates is under study. \n\nThe original Achilles Apparatus is more than 100 years old, but has been extended over the following decades. The current manifestation includes a console containing panels with switches, lights and other controls.  The console is surrounded by three illuminated antenna masts. A separate desk contains notebooks, pictures and audio recordings about the history of the Achilles Apparatus.\n\nSuccessfully activating the Achilles Apparatus is a complicated process that generally requires several people working together to manipulate the controls.",

Once in motion this will allow the participant on the throne to experience not only a rain on the roof, but a \"rain through the roof\" sensory experience.",

This pocket of altered acoustics contrasts strongly with the vast openness of the playa, transporting participants to a sonic environment that is at once familiar and new. Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa's surface, scattered across an area approximately 60 feet in diameter.",

The Shots Fired machine is a naked machine, fully unclothed to show the beauty of the interaction of heat, pressure and temperature in the creation of coffee. The ideal gas law PV=nRT is at the heart of good espresso. By obeying the law, coffee is created with hot (not boiling!) water under pressure at a precise temperature, squirted through beans that have been ground to the consistency required to cause 1 oz of water to flow through the puck at a pressure of 100 PSI.

        "description": "Dimensional Dreams is a set of four roughly 1ft cubed shadow boxes. Each shadow box is inspired by a different artist's personal vision of relaxation and rejuvenation. Artists have submitted drawings or photographs that have been translated into a 3D landscape. The project is inspired by a collective feeling of fast-paced stressful life and the lack of time for mindfulness and sanctuary. \r\n\r\nDimensional Dreams is constructed of a wood frame with acrylic layers illuminated by colorful LEDs. Each layer is laser cut semi-translucent cast-acrylic and between each layer of acrylic an individual strip of neopixels would illuminate that layer.  \r\n\r\nEach box is affixed to conduit piping that is 48\" tall, which makes Dimensional Dreams ADA accessible.",

This past fall our community here in California was hit by the devastating fires that destroyed hundreds of homes and affected so many lives. These events have deeply changed us. \n\nAs a visual metaphor to transcendence and metamorphosis, our team is building a sculpture out of the ruins from the fire and is bringing it to another place of deep personal transformation: Burning Man. And after the Burn, the sculpture will be publicly installed in California. \n\nThe wings span 60 feet across, and are built out of recycled metal, iridescent dichroic acrylic panels and thousands of LED lights.",

At sunrise and sunset the installation invites for meditation. Burners ascend and descend the central staircase experiencing a golden hue of warmth from the sun.

        "description": "Mirroring the ephemeral nature of the customary birthday cake \u2013 a whimsical work of art made to be immediately consumed in celebration \u2013 the MEGA CAKE is made, shared  with all of the citizens of Black Rock City, and then consumed by fire. On a city-wide scale, it stands as a joyful beacon to the metamorphoses we experience throughout our lifetimes. Interior stairs provide access to elevated decks where participants can take in a sweeping 365\u00b0 view of the beautiful playa. A slide to the ground acts as a playful symbol of one's birth anew. On a universal scale, the cake serves as a marker in time \u2014 a point to deliberately consider the significance of each being and celebrate a deeper understanding of self and community.",

Two 7-thousand-pound basalt stone columns stand guard from the left and from the right. Portal will also be lit with an increasing laser light show controlled on a theremin device, with sound effects that go off when one enters.\r\n\r\nSymbiosis.\r\n\r\nThe color in harmony attracts vitality through beauty, like a flower does a bee. The bee gets food in exchange for spreading pollen. In the same manner one attracts to Portal.

The sculpture will incorporate large wood birds made from reclaimed wood beams salvaged from a demolished commercial building. We will resurface the beams down to a restored finish. Large custom bearing plates will be incorporated at each balance point of the birds that will rotate independently allowing the sculpture to slide in the wind. The axis of the piece will stretch ascending linearly in orientation to the Man. A large steel metal feather will sit at the forward apex of the sculpture symbolizing the fragility of the balance. The kinetic sculpture will honor the migration and the collaborative movement of nature and its processes.",

Its very easy to look back in hindsight and just champion the amazing results left after a transformation has occurred however the actual process of transforming is often a messy, uncomfortable, vulnerable process full of uncertainty and struggle. Our goal is to show the rawness of this process in both its pain and its glory.\nUltimately the whole cycle of life, from birth to death, is one never ending process of continual transformation. We symbolize this cyclical process in the show as performers move in a circular pattern from earth to sky and back again. Winding up in the same place they started again and also arriving somewhere completely new simultaneously.",

I believe in deconstructing the gender binary, that gender expression should be fluid and it is exciting for me to explore the liberating contemporary metamorphosis of gender through cabaret and aerial. \r\nIn this piece, using costume, physical theatre, clowning, drag and aerial I will explore the extreme femme - the Showgirl, against the extreme masc - the Drag King. I'll dress up and strip down as either character and the act concludes as I assimilate both archetypes.",

We think this classic piece of our repertoire would be framed perfectly in the arches under the man. It transforms depending on the performers we choose to inhabit it. We will be referencing the first law of Thermodynamics - \"Energy can be transformed from one form to another, but can be neither created nor destroyed.\" As the orb rotates, it spins passively and then is reinvigorated by each layer of self that exits the shape. First the layer of family is shed, then romantic love and then self. Like peeling an onion, each layer is shed until the only thing left is the vibrating inner core - empty and universal.",

They begin their performance rising in a lyra/hoop where they'll perform a choreographed routine with symbolic bendy caterpillar moves and flexibility movement. As the caterpillars reach the cocoon performers, the cocoons start to rise and perform the next act. When the cocoon performer reaches the butterflies, the butterflies discover their wings and begin to learn to fly. They will rise into the air and fly with hand painted large silk wings in a routine that includes flipping forward and backwards and choreographed wing dance. As the butterflies come down they will be met with their \"mate\" butterfly partner who will dance, play, and fly together in a choreographed piece symbolizing their mating. This dance will end in the death of all coming to a close",

The main icons are a press clock which in a very subtle subliminal way lets us know everything is going to be fine no matter what because we are part of nature and time is not real. A boat, to emphasize we are floating in space and at the same time we are individuals surrounded by the illusion of what we think it is, it is all about perceptions. I am using wood to create the foundation of everything, to continuing having a nature presence, LED lighting will be creating the illusion of movement and will make it possible for it become a real nighttime piece. The size of this piece will be 8.5' x11'.",

The Chapel of the Chimes awaits you.\r\n\r\nThe love poured into the structure makes it a perfect place to have a ceremony with loved ones. There is an arch inside and platform to stand. Share your vows, commitments, and devotion here.\r\n\r\nYou may also simply take shelter here from the hot sun and relax to the sound of the wind breezing through, giving the wind a different voice and experience. The chimes harmonize and sing you a song you've not yet heard.\r\n\r\nCome and learn of the playa-adjacent origins of the structure! It has quite a story to share. Come early, it burns before the end of the event!",

Five aerialists will start in separate spaces on unique elements. Slowly, as the music progresses, they will begin to notice each other and interact. The ultimate vision is to perform the transformation we go through as humans from being sad and alone to finding our place in a literal and figurative 'home.' Beyond this, we are all from different countries but make our home in Israel. As aerialists, burners and women, we share many common bonds. We want to share our hope for peace in Israel and Palestine by performing a number that ultimately shows the connections that are possible when people connect. These connections transform us. And this transformation -- from hate to love and misunderstanding to acceptance -- creates 'home.' By reaching that place physically, we can reach it emotionally.",

The Bees are bronze in colour, but on their dancing feet they wear gleaming copper ballet shoes with copper ribbons. The Bees are transformed into dancers.",

A 10-foot tall feminine bird-like figure, welded from raw steel rods and tubes, her wings spread wide, takes flight from her perch upon a 10-foot tall spoked wheel, representing the circle of life.  Viewers interact by making colorful ropes and weaving them into the wheel as a metaphor of releasing one's past. Experiences already lived through can't be erased, but they can speak their truths, and be let go.

It is hand-powered, and the energy transmitted by the human motor flows into the creativity and joy of the people spinning on the platform.\r\n\r\nZarya in Russian means the sunrise, and this name references the possibility of a post-apocalyptic utopia. The carousel looks hellish, but when it starts to move and emit light and sound, it becomes a celebration of creativity and the irrepressible ecstasy of life. If humanity itself can learn to produce light and love, it will be able to continue even after a societal collapse. That's why the Carousel Zarya is hand-powered: the person himself becomes the main driver of movement, joy and life in general.",
