        "description": "The Temple of Direction is organized linearly. It recreates a restricted passage which expands in the center into a large hall. This is a response to the openness of the playa; it creates a space traveled end to end; versus wandering an open plan; this temple provides direction and focus. Linearity also reflects the passage of life; all lives have a beginning, a middle and an end which metaphorically is included in this temple's form. Following this metaphor a variety of spaces are created; narrow spaces and wide spaces, dark spaces and bright spaces. Tunnels  create intimate experiences with shade.. A large central hall expands in width and height providing a bright area suitable for gatherings.",

When designing it, the Notre Dame was ablaze with fire, and I thought to turn the sadness of that catastrophe, into something beautiful. It's lines were borrowed from the famous Rose Sud that sit above the entrance. Whenever the Mandala is present it's meant to create a more sacred space and radiate splendid emotion",

Under each piece is a bench back to sit and lean against. Within this six sided circular structure there is no beginning or end. The wind speaks to those who will listen via the structure.

After the Tohoku earthquake, this disconnected telephone became touchstone and a conduit of grief. Our phone booth structure is inspired by traditional Japanese Shoji screens and resembles a large Japanese lantern. Inside is an old telephone with a voicemail system that will record any story participants wish to share.  The intention is to create a private, tranquil space for folks to talk with someone or something they miss and record their story if they choose. There is also an option to listen to messages left by others. Grief is a powerful metamorphic force and the Dust Phone seeks to hold the stories of that change.",

The top is a dense black peak - the zone beyond the event horizon! By ducking in one side, then standing up, a participant's head is inside the Black Hole! No escape!! \nOn closer look the structure is covered with what? Crochet! But made from what?! It's Tarn!  (T-shirts repurposed into a thick yarn.) \nIt highlights the recently-released first visual image of a Black Hole, elucidated largely by a female scientist. The shape represents the dramatic deformation of space-time by a Black Hole. Who knew T-shirts could metamorphose into a visualization of a cosmic singularity?!",

Two pieces anchor the exhibit. One: An Aeolean harp, a 14ft tall string instrument based on a concept of ancient Greece and built around a trampoline salvaged from a destroyed family home. Two: A wooden windmill, 12ft tall rigged to chime via wind motion. An adjunct is a canon causing a gong to strike semi-randomly.

Indulge in a daily dose of truth and humor as the message on the marquee board changes daily. Come light your fire with the fireplace of burning handwritten words that reads \"I still love you.\" And finally, ponder on the neon conundrum \"Those who know themselves know their/they're God\".

The pyramid base of the plant resembles a circuit board trunk with digital roots into the playa and large leaves sprouting from the top. Wooden benches surround the Plantern to create a communal gathering space. Analog controls are interactive to create various colorful and dynamic light patterns on the flowering lantern. Electric Plantern offers participants a place of refuge to discover, dream, or meet.",

Nine tall, elegant, mystical, glowing cat statues representing the nine lives of cats arrayed in a circle and shooting lasers from their eyes in geometric array towards the central shrine of Pussiopolis, the sanctum of Holofelinity.  Cathenge is an interactive light and sound sculpture that explores the harmonics of purring and emanates kitty kundalini.  The central shrine of Pussiopolis with its three Sekhmet Lioness Goddess heads forms an interior sanctuary where people may commune with 'Holofelinity' the universal cat consciousness.  Pussiopolis is surrounded by three mighty pillars with braziers of fire upon their capitals, and the shrine is surmounted by a dome containing the vast array of magical Catulets.",

You let go of the button and your fresh beat continues on loop. Your friends each take a turn and together you make a joyous cacophony of silliness! \r\n\r\nBurning Man shifts the paradigm of art from a commodified object of consumption to an interactive, participatory, shared experience of creative expression. Everyone loves music, but many people have never experienced the joy of making music. This piece illustrates how easy and fun that process can be.",

Five intimate, pentagonal chambers let participants deeply immerse themselves in the experience, while the open-air center space allows for larger gatherings. A 39' tower rises up from the center's intricately designed dias while detailed artworks adorn the space.",

This past fall our community here in California was hit by the devastating fires that destroyed hundreds of homes and affected so many lives. These events have deeply changed us. \n\nAs a visual metaphor to transcendence and metamorphosis, our team is building a sculpture out of the ruins from the fire and is bringing it to another place of deep personal transformation: Burning Man. And after the Burn, the sculpture will be publicly installed in California. \n\nThe wings span 60 feet across, and are built out of recycled metal, iridescent dichroic acrylic panels and thousands of LED lights.",

Primarily of wood construction, the sculpture will stand ~20 ft tall and consist of several interactive elements (such as a rotating hourglass) that invite visitors to engage with questions about time. A fully functional sundial by day will evoke thoughts of ancient time keeping. At night it will transform to a digital timepiece and be illuminated by thousands of LEDs.

Time, in this piece, is a paradox and an illusion as it combines the future and the past, simultaneously presenting a quantitative measuring system with a qualitative one.\n\nThe concept illustrates how motion and time change according to our perceptions. It represents the evolution of time management and our obsession with the passage of time. It suggests to the observer that all matter may shrink into a tiny dot again, which will end the concept of time as we know it. This sculpture is to discover ways to distort time, exaggerate perceptions or to embellish the estimation of time, all within the shifting sands of Playa time.",

Although it has enabled innovation and permeated human culture around the world, the consequences of using this seemingly magical material without due diligence are becoming clear.",

Some may choose to try out both of these modes of engagement thereby switching between the roles of the magician (the illusion-maker or fascinator) and the spectator (the perceiver or the one fascinated).",

During the day Burners see their reflections evolve inside the fragmented mirrors as they move through the sand winds and find shelter in its corners and covers. At sunrise and sunset the installation invites for meditation. Burners ascend and descend the central staircase experiencing a golden hue of warmth from the sun. At night, \"Fragments\" shifts again into abstract LED surfaces creating a magical apparition in the desert darkness.",

The head rests in repose while its left hand claws at its mind fighting to reveal a crystalline stained glass structure akin to the \"Space Whale\" inside.\r\n\r\nA series of hidden doors in the mouth, wrists and head open into a four story, 18 room maze.

After all, the \"oil god\", charging all he offers, can be replaced by an older, benevolent god, the Sun.\r\n\r\nIt is urgent to be \"freaky\", yes, and fear not the ignorance or darkness we live today. The Compass Rose illuminates Love, and only empathy Shines against fear and defeats walls or borders.\r\n\r\nThe Burner, pedaling the Rose, generates new forces, destroying the dogma of a single and polluting North. Ridding the rose we dream about alternatives. We gently believe that in Art, there will never be aesthetic without an ethic.",

Fiber glass resin was applied, until the toad felt ready to be painted (dressed). Finally being covered with a shiny lacquer finish.\r\nMetamorphatoad has hole running through it so that dusty visitors may connect to the experience of portaling through the frog, cleansing, or metamorphizing.\r\nI really want to capture the essence of 'toad medicine' in the painting of this piece.

In addition, it gifts control of this power into human hands, allowing a blurring of roles between mortal and divine.",

It will be exciting to see citizens of Black Rock City experience the rush (and heat!) of one's own heartbeat pulsing through and with the Fire of the Phoenix!

These handguns will rest on their grips with the barrels pointed skyward and they will be visually stunning as well as provocative. This piece is meant to represent our society's fascination and fear with handguns and violence. It takes no side in the debate, while being too massive to ignore. The viewer is invited to literally and figuratively \"play with danger.\"",

Several of the people working on it were or became insane; the mechanism by which it operates is under study. \n\nThe original Achilles Apparatus is more than 100 years old, but has been extended over the following decades. The current manifestation includes a console containing panels with switches, lights and other controls.  The console is surrounded by three illuminated antenna masts. A separate desk contains notebooks, pictures and audio recordings about the history of the Achilles Apparatus.\n\nSuccessfully activating the Achilles Apparatus is a complicated process that generally requires several people working together to manipulate the controls.",

We can try to solve it alone or with others. We can enjoy the journey or focus only on the destination. How we attempt solve the puzzle is more important that the solution itself.",

Its a place to acknowledge wishes as affirmations of how we imagine our best selves into being. Genie allows us to have no restrictions on our requests. Dreams are not just your own, they are connected with everyone else. It's about nuances of communication.

Upon finding the entrance in the prefrontal cortex, they enter into a wide-open and comfortable space to relax and rest their brains. A glowing screen wraps around the back wall. \r\n\r\nDeeper examination into the dark recesses of the mind, however, shows that the entire screen is made up of hundreds of transparent dildos, each a giant LED pixel. Upon exploration, each dildo proves to be a switch, so the next participants to enter the space might find a group of Burners gleefully running across the length of the wall, slapping the dildos to trigger visual effects, puzzle solutions, or noises.",

Strung from a branch is a hammock made of fishing net attached to a ocean buoy marooned on the beach. Hanging from the branches are sea buoys and balls providing a place to write names or leave a message to those who will come after. \n\nHanging from branches are bamboo wind chimes that softly clatter in the breeze. It is an island, a refuge, a place of calm and childhood in the stormy seas of life. It appears out of the playa as a mirage, the fantasy playground of youth. Discarded materials transform into an oasis, as our adult lives transform back to childhood. Bangarang!",

The sculpture will incorporate large wood birds made from reclaimed wood beams salvaged from a demolished commercial building. We will resurface the beams down to a restored finish. Large custom bearing plates will be incorporated at each balance point of the birds that will rotate independently allowing the sculpture to slide in the wind. The axis of the piece will stretch ascending linearly in orientation to the Man. A large steel metal feather will sit at the forward apex of the sculpture symbolizing the fragility of the balance. The kinetic sculpture will honor the migration and the collaborative movement of nature and its processes.",

Unlike electronic displays or LEDs, the fluid exhibits subtle three-dimensionality, reflecting sunlight off the surfaces of the liquid in interesting ways. It is physical and real, yet completely magical at the same time. The display showcases several interesting physics: magnetic force and magnetization, fluid mechanics, surface tension and gravity.",

We also need to expand out and see beyond ourselves; to connect with our tribe. So we come to understand that to change the smallest part is to change the nature of the whole.

Or if your death's likely cause were beyond your control, would you do nothing different? Mortorious counts the number of deaths in the United States, by cause, from the opening of the Gate for Burning Man 2019. Digital counters reveal mortality statistics along with 16 small \"cause-of-death\" posters that \"promote\" the most likely ways that we will leave this Earthly realm. The posters also show what you can do, if anything, to try and avoid an early demise. But even if you know what you should do, will you?",

Spoken words, hand claps, performances on musical instruments, and all other sounds made within the installation are rewarded with a lush, surround-sound response as they are echoed throughout the space by a number of small pillars rising above the playa's surface, scattered across an area approximately 60 feet in diameter.",

The ideal gas law PV=nRT is at the heart of good espresso. By obeying the law, coffee is created with hot (not boiling!) water under pressure at a precise temperature, squirted through beans that have been ground to the consistency required to cause 1 oz of water to flow through the puck at a pressure of 100 PSI.

The questions in each category of the menu take the conversation from light to thought provoking, and everything in between. The idea is to facilitate communication since we often struggle with connection in the default world.",

The first one implies that everyone can visit our ##Darkart camp to create his/her own child, widening the range of the figures every day. The second way is to interact on playa with the previously prepared children.

It was 60 by 30 meters, several meters tall, and contained an estimated 60,000 skulls.  \n\nThis BRC tzompantli is a replica of the ancient ones.

This is the chance for participants to ask those questions and more of the people that have done it and know what to do.\r\n\r\nThe show will move around the inner playa to various locations for 4 days over the course of the week. Locations can be near esplanade, the keyholes, major art pieces or camps. The intent is to add diversity to the city and reach different areas of the city by rotating the locations on each of the 4 days of the event the show will be held on.",

Each layer is laser cut semi-translucent cast-acrylic and between each layer of acrylic an individual strip of neopixels would illuminate that layer.  \r\n\r\nEach box is affixed to conduit piping that is 48\" tall, which makes Dimensional Dreams ADA accessible.",

The large pipe juts up from the playa at a very low angle. It ends at eye height. Below it's opening a small podium awaits.  As the participant reaches out to touch the podium, they will notice a soft musical sound starting to emit. If they move their hand closer to the antenna, the pitch of the sound will rise, and as they move their hand away the pitch will fall. The experience will be the interface of a traditional theramin, but with a more real, physical sound in lieu of the traditional synthesized sound.",

They are creatively concocted by 25 different people from ages 3 to 75. Each star tells a story, some are head scratchers, all are quirky. They are created with almost 100% recycled objects, repurposed items from yard sales or found objects.

It shines like a Moroccan lantern at night, and beckons viewers to rest in a plush interior, seek shade, duck a windstorm. It incubates change.
