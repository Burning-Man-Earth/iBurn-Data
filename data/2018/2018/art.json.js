People will be able to climb up the roots and \"get inside her head\" bouncing and rocking with the use of large suspension springs. Flo represents the notion of learning to flow with all of the parts of one's self, and finding strength within them. Her roots correlate with all of the deepest parts of ourselves--the buried parts, which make us who we are. Exposing the roots and making them a part of the blossom at the top represents the idea that everything is an integral part of the whole self, even (and especially) the buried parts--not just the pretty flowery surface parts.",

Since birth, SYMMETRA has suffered from agoraphobia and thusly developed a strongly misanthropic personality. Her main mode of expression is her body language, through which she communicates her emotional states. If left alone SYMMETRA creates slow, harmonic movement patterns on the surface of her skin. But if anyone gets close to her, she becomes more and more frightened and reduces her movement drastically. If someone gets even closer, SYMMETRA panics and starts to convulse heavily until given back the space she needs to be comfortable.",

One with legs, claws, eyeballs and antennae made out of rusty farm equipment. \r\n\r\nA 1978 F-150 masquerading as a rusty crustacean wearing a giant bison skull on it's back the way a hermit crab inhabits the shell of another sea creature. \r\n\r\nThe top of the skull is cut off and suspended between the horns. Occupying the space below and looking up, one is confronted by the smooth convulations of the underside of the skull plate that corresponds to the shape of the brain that used to live there. Makes you think...maybe the about the bison and the people.",

The blades move in the wind and just like \"real\" grass the blades lean on each other in community for collective strength. Humans may take note of this and learn how working together is more powerful than going it alone. A single blade snaps under pressure, a collective of blades spreads the load and thrives.\r\nThe oasis created by Playa Grass Ballet is a gathering point for shade in the daytime, for conversation and light based visual meditation at night. We hope those interacting with the sculpture will come closer together, converse, heal and visualize greater harmony through naturally designed co-reliance.",

The posts are wrapped in LED light rope and are each equipped with a mirror that faces the central obelisk. The obelisk, made up of aluminum sheets with hundreds of holes poked into them, will shine in the playa sun and emit strange lights through the holes at night. Throughout human history, obelisks, with their upwardly-tapered walls, have been used to either symbolize or direct attention to the sun (Earth's source of light). Thus, Photoasis (named after the particles which make up light, photons) simply pays its respects to and represents the light that begins each day.",

Today, this can be applied to many areas in medicine. For example, advances in science and technology can prolong life significantly but at the cost of quality. Three areas will be addressed: the patient, the provider, and the struggle of both of these to retain their humanity as they interact in the world of medicine. Each of these components has its own set of conundrums, ironies, and hypocrisies. These will be represented on prayer flags and will be illuminated by a different color light.",

The structure is a place to reflect on the decisions we've made or choices we will have to make. The man is sculpted as a physically strong figure to remind people that making a choice takes strength and courage and should not be taken lightly. In the day time, the viewer can come take refuge in the space and look at the sculpture in the severe desert light to see the starkness of a situation. At night, they can return and see the space lit up with the dancing lights of possibilities, showing that with strength comes beauty, kindness, and the possibility of a better world.",

Perhaps this powerful visual system can be used for something different. Perhaps these tools can be used for self-affirmation and empathy.",

You never know what the next one will bring, but they all will put smiles on your faces. . This project continues the tradition of BlinkingManCamp97, a strong tradition on the playa of theme camps, volunteering, big time gifting,   and art projects.

These series of four puzzles \u2013 each four by three feet - provides a fun, fairly simple, but mildly challenging set of puzzle. If nothing else, we hope it will provide you one more incentive to find corners of the playa you might not have wandered into; and to collaborate with fellow Burners who you find also working on a puzzle. The four puzzles are located in camps. Best of luck to all and keep scratching your head, you will get it!",

Our world view and what we assume is real is constructed by it and yet we are never aware of it.  The crack is an opening into another reality... one that is outside of you and your everyday understanding, yet it is found deep inside your heart and is connected to your true being. Human consciousness has the capacity to experience this reality, so when you find a crack in your reality... don't hesitate, jump in.",

The patterns originate in traditional and ancient Chinese fretwork but are manipulated with digital tools to create a contemporary interpretation.  The Lantern is an intricate structure that is as beautiful lit only by the sun in the daytime as it is when filled with man-made light at night. In China lanterns can also symbolize letting go of past selves and gaining a new self, a concept Burners can contemplate as they nestle in the heart of the structure.",

It tells a story of death and a life unfulfilled because of the lack of another person. The presence of love be it romantic or not in our lives should heighten our potential to give back, to be our best selves. Life should not be about the love received, but the love we are lucky enough to send out everyday.",

The shadows act on the performer, a skater moving at various tempos relative to glide and stillness upon a synthetic (plastic) ice surface, by visually impacting movements, focus, and awareness of environmental interactions as light plays between umbra, penumbra, and illuminant upon the canvas. Projections will cast shadows in a kaleidoscopic ring around the performer or objects in the highlighted space. In this way the plastic surface and playa will be transformed into a canvas upon which light paints shadows interacting with one another and the performer.",

We are hoping our \"circle of friends\" will inspire the community circle of friends. Ultimately we plan to have fire effects and viewer participation! This year we are doing a single humanoid figure as a preview for our larger scale project in 2019.",

The structure is teepee shaped. There is space at the bottom of the huddle for a small group of participants to seek refuge from the sun, relax and listen to the guided meditation and soundtrack that is part of the sculpture. At night the sculpture is lit in a such a way that it glows from the inside cradling the participant into a lullaby of trust and surrender. \nThe piece embodies space of being lovingly held by a benevolent tribe. Whether we trust or fear depends on our ability to surrender to the severity and the beauty of the divine flow. So, Do You Trust?",

Upon closer inspection, the intersection seems to have appeared from a parallel universe. The universe where Burning Man expanded beyond the trash fence, found a way into the urban realm, and modified it.\n\nFor most of us, the world of Burning Man and the everyday world are parallel universes, and The Intersection represents our dream of a place where these realities meet and exist simultaneously.",

It had a very primitive but effective shock absorbing and impact diverting system. This art piece enlarges the armor to a height of 15 metres weighing 10 tons and embedded the soul of a Mongolian warrior. It wants to remind everyone, that we must never use artificial intelligence for war. Otherwise, humanity creates weapons that kill us. We hope that this warrior makes us realise that we shouldn't only worship technology, but also put restrictions in place.",

Some things may be as reliable as the sun rising, but where would we be when they stopped? As humans and as artists, we thrive to answer the question of how we react when the impossible occurs. When it dawns on us that our expectations were wrong, do we see through it... or do we blink?",

Over the course of the week, we are planning to distribute 10,000 patches through the art piece.  The risk:  all of the remaining mousetraps that hang from the other rings might be set and could be triggered as one pursues a reward.  Not to worry, all of the \"risk\" mousetraps have had their springs modified to reduce the power so the traps only have a bark and no bite.",

This wedge is a mathematical enigma that has eluded mathematicians for millennia. It is an example of forbidden symmetry.\nThe Temple of Incompletion is an ode to the unsolved problems and the unanswered questions, it is a reminder that it is important for some things to remain unfinished, incomplete, open.",

Two Mutant vehicles would be utilized as a starting line and finish line. Times kept and trophies awarded on Sun am to winners.\r\nThe base vehicle is a 1974 international truck with a rear side dropping down platform base that will raise to a height of 15', the other being a small 6 wheeler made to be the starting line, cones marking the length of track of 1/8 mile (327')\r\nIt's our gift to the Mutant Vehicle owners to have some reaction competition in driving and the people of Burning Man to enjoy some drag race fun.",

We have the ability to choose, to decide, and to live our life as true as we can.  We do not aspire to be a Robot, we aspire to be free, alive and true to ourselves.",

The trains will initially be sited at the distant ends of the track, and on the day of the burn, pulled together into a fiery exploding end.  In addition train station will stand beside the track to provide shade and railroad history.",

On one end, a beautiful, blue, pristine ocean is filled with sailfish, tuna, and mackerel; continuing through, fish become smaller and sparser, the ocean greener and murkier. A thick curtain of jellyfish tentacles hangs from the ceiling of the final section--the whole ocean has become a gelatinous soup.\r\nOcean Tunnel is intended to show how the ocean is evolving -- how climate change and unsustainable fishing practices degrade ocean ecosystems.

The \"Cosmic Turtle\" is an ancient and peaceful protector of this tiny world, a mytheme found in Hindu, Chinese, and Indigenous American mythology. This ancient symbolism is combined with reflective futuristic design to conjure visions of a \"Spaceship Earth\" voyaging through the cosmos into the great unknown.",

While idle, it busies itself writing and humming songs about the current conditions abound. If given a zip code it will query the live weather conditions of the area in question and use the data to compose and perform a brief, wholly unique musical composition.\n\nCirrus is meant to question the nature of inspiration and artistic creation. Using a natural dataset, Cirrus operates within a learned musical framework. This method of creating is meant to mirror our own artistic process and growth.",

Within the kiln the magic happens at temperatures over 1600\u00b0F. As flames shoot out of the chimney the kiln roars full of pendents and tiles decorated with various glazes and playa dust which turn to glass and solidify. The raging inferno ends with a moment of silence before the faint crackling sound fills the kiln as the glazes crackle and craze from the sudden temperature drop. When the kiln opens a red hot glow begins to grow as the top rolls down the elongated frame. Slowly the glow dims and reveals the beautiful colors and textures of all the ceramic pieces that were just hand decorated shortly before. The process of firing ceramics is an ancient tradition that dates back as far as the first known civilizations of human kind, and this installation allows the participant to connect with their most ancient roots.",

Remembering that we are going to die is a profound and universally-accessible key to appreciating the here and now. \r\n\r\nStudies show that when people are exposed to concepts of their mortality, we perform tasks better, are more creative, and value collectivism more, and value the present more.\r\n\r\nOur mortality is, unexpectedly, a source of joy, of motivation to live, and an inspiration to play. We have only now. \r\n\r\nYou might die tomorrow. So live today.",

Clear plastic eggs (provided) allow even very small gifts to be donated and easily seen/retrieved with the claw.   A sticker affixed to each egg reminds Receivers to recycle the egg into the attached basket for use by the next Gifter.   \r\n\r\nUnlike commercial models in the prize prevention business, HAND OF THE MAN is reengineered to deliver on the first or second try.   \r\n\r\nAlthough initially pre-stocked with donated gifts from Burners at-large so as to prime the gifting pump, thereafter it becomes a self-sustaining experiment seeking spontaneous equilibrium between net Gifters and Receivers.",

Glitch represents us and the chain represents our connection and dependence on the concept of diamonds as a symbol of love. \n\nBoth diamonds are lined with LEDs. The larger diamond will sparkle, display beautiful light patterns, and will be responsive to the participants voice.

I will ask people to share their story, or something important to them to inspire the portrait.  I would bring sculptures & my work to create an installation that focuses on acceptance and love. I would then invite people to hang out in the installation (it would be set up with places to chat), to talk to one another and to me. People that came to hang out in the installation would be offered the opportunity to get their story or portrait painted. They would be able to bring this painting home with them.

It symbolizes abundance, life, fertility. It is food, subsistence, of which without, the human race would be extinct. Viewers can look closer at the inherent  beauty of the human form, contemplate mechanics/technology or most importantly, be reminded of our absolute reliance on nature in the end.",

The sculpture is fundamentally an open symbol. The break in the form demands attention, presenting the shifting dualities of continuity and rupture, menace and security, unbidden fear and unearned trust. It is both heavy and light, impossible, yet it stands, challenging our perceptions.   Timeless and transient, the stone arch stands in contrast to our disposable culture.",

Four prismatic towers 30ft tall stand in a circle and bend and sway inwards and outwards in a hypnotic dance. Meanwhile, colors dance and swirl around the sculpture, within and amongst the towers on high density LED arrays. Participants can control the movement and lighting through an interactive interface.",

Its Body is an interactive mechanical sculpture activated by environmental factors and human attention. Its Soul is a blockchain-based software governing its reproduction.\nWandering through the playa, you may stumble on the Plantoid Garden, in the middle of which are three giant 10 to 20 foot tall mechanical plants made of welded scrap metal, with a strong but elegant steampunk flavor. Their stems are made of large, industrial chain; their leaves are made of photovoltaic panels and their flowers of forged metal. Half plant, half-android, they come to life when triggered with sunlight, wind and human attention.",

The unlatched door of the birdcage lies open, and a swing invites participants to step inside. Over time, flowering vines have crept up the back and wrapped around the birdcage.\r\n\r\nSet away from the cage are large flowers adorned with fire elements and lighting. The flowers create a natural perimeter. At night, the ambient light and warmth emitted by the large flowers will draw people in.",

Adults can weigh as much as eight hundred pounds. The most significant and endearing aspect of these giant playa octopuses is their ability to communicate and emote with playa visitors.

It is a place to congregate expressively and playfully under, to wonder at the sky though, and for making friends around. Sky Mandala is a \"social-sculpture\" i.e. a community generating venue to be located in the (9&B plaza?). The weaving of mandalas is a metaphor that realizes that which it symbolizes: the making of new friendships through collaborative art-making, which weaves a web of creatively empowered community. The artifact that the participants create is a molecular looking framework of wood, string mandalas, and at night, lighting. This artifact will offer a venue of expression and gather for neighborhood culture throughout the week. The camps in the neighborhood will network to offer open-invitation happenings and performances using this sculpture as a venue. The sculpture will grow as our neighborhood community grows through mandala making and erecting workshops that will allow the larger community to help expand the initial sculpture -- for many it will be their first chance at doing hands-on burning man sculptural art! \r\n\r\nIt\u2019s meaning and intended result is the web of relationships that arise from participation, networking, openness, inclusion, bonding, and commitment to community and to celebratory art culture. If you would like to donate or participate on the build team, please email us. If you have an idea for fantastic performance art, fine oration, mind-bending experience, silly social game, or absurd etc. for the center of the plaza please reach out and we will connect you with the neighborhood planning conversation being facilitated by placement and the art department.",

They will be stacked into a 6-7 foot tall piece, held together by a metal pole, with little sun at the base and dad at the top. Participants will be able to change the positioning of arms and legs, and play with each robot's additional bits (i.e. wooden around bead maze or tic-tac-toe board).",

Using stereo-cards viewed through a specially designed, multi-station, interactive viewer, the PtP brings the magic of Victorian entertainment to today's audience.  It is also a place to learn how to take your own 3d images and the PtP welcomes submissions for new images to add to the library.",

Creu Hudol is feminine in appearance calling upon a softer and and receptive feel. Her joints are made of glass to emulate the crystals used in technology today. Her open posture represents her willingness to serve others for the betterment of humanity. Her upright and proud stance representing her power. The glass crown represents a spiritual element, bringing in points of light to catch the eye. Her head is clear and made of glass representing an open and clear understanding (perhaps to be filled with new ideas). Creu Hudol stands upon a pedestal of glass panels to rise her up even higher into consciousness.",

The magic of divination and deep insight will be encouraged by the energy of each individual searching for greater awareness of themselves and their environment. Participants can ask a question while they are mixing up giant runes in a large bag container by means of an overhead pulley. Three to ten runes are selected to be placed on the rune reading platform for public view. Interpretations can be provided by Happytoobehere or by anyone who is welcomed by the seeker to support their quest. The chosen runes can be noted on a scroll that will be burned in the Temple. Postcards will be available so that a summary can be mailed to  the participant prior to next year's Burn.",

The Traveling Sound Museum has preserved a sonic collection of historic marvels and is pleased to make its bounty available to the citizens of Black Rock City in a rare public exhibition. This year's collection, discovered in Empire, NV when gypsum mines opened there in 1923, contains sounds previously thought lost forever when pioneers died transporting the barrels along the Nobles Trail in 1862.",

Using a subversive formula of colliding seemingly innocent images with meaningful messages, my subtle alterations to known designs irrevocably disrupt their meaning. For instance, in my iconic Vandal Gummy series, I place the beloved sugary treat against a prison mugshot background, gripping an identity placard in between his gelatin paws. This juxtaposition between the nostalgic and the sinister has become a hallmark for my body of work. I cleverly and strategically encourage my viewers to examine their own critique of problematic institutions. It will look like a Giant 14' incarcerated Gummy Bear :)",

This solar powered cactus garden uses only its immediate resources to live. It's a sustainable oasis deep in the electronic desert where weird plants and animals thrive.\r\n\r\nUsing only sunlight and the occasional rain, cacti evolved to use no more than what they need.  This spoke to me as a powerful potential direction I hope Burning Man can take, to become a more sustainable event and for its participants better citizens of the planet. We can evolve past using diesel, gasoline, and propane to create Black Rock City each year.  We can create life-changing art and experiences and also be good stewards of the environment.",
