HOW TO PARTICIPATE IN THE 2014 3:15 EXPERIMENT:\r\n\r\n    Begin at 3:15 AM on August 1 (or whenever you can join!). Continue each day until August 31.\r\n    You may write any length, style, form, content, voice, rhythm, etc.\r\n    DO NOT EDIT your work. This is raw stuff, baby. That\u2019s part of the experiment. You are welcome to edit, collage, break apart the poems later for whatever purpose you choose, but please SHARE THE RAW STUFF with us on the website after the experiment.\r\n    (Optional) Do not read what you have written until the month is over, except to skim the work to make sure everything is legible.\r\n    TIP: do not use a felt tip pen unless you don\u2019t care about ink stains on your bed. Many a poet has fallen asleep in the middle of writing.\r\n    If you can help it, don\u2019t even get out of bed! The point is to ride that dream state, that precarious point between sleeping and waking and sleeping.\r\n\r\nThen come by our camp to share your writing! Read on the Big TV Set or in the Dome of the Space Wanderer. \r\n\r\nIf you're up at 3:15am, stop by our camp, be inspired by the otherworldly artwork, and write!",

(screamed loudly with a typical Texas drawl to express joy or exuberance) promises to be the most interactive and entertaining see-saw you've ever experienced.\r\n\r\nAt 33' long x 28' tall, this perfectly balanced see-saw includes an adult playground comprised of a dance platform, pole and jungle gym. A center pole rises through the dance platform and moves with the Yee-Saw. Dancers can use this to radically express themselves while also controlling the riders' experience. Scale the triangular truss to operate from the top of the pole and for a great view of the playa.\r\n\r\nThis year, the machine has successfully entertained the nearly 3,000 member strong Burning Flipside community. It\u2019s now eagerly waiting to play with all of you beautiful people.\r\n\r\nSeatbelts ON!\r\nIt\u2019s Yee-Saw Time!",

The tours are flexible so feel free to join us on playa if you see a bunch of bikes traveling in a pack, or drop out if you want. The tour starts promptly at the bike racks across from the ARTery (on the Esplanade).

Most of the art on the playa is self-funded, so be sure to check out your favorite art projects on the Burning Man website now, and then help fund them or volunteer through their respective websites.

For a mashup, they could name the different performers, and the different songs, depending on how many songs are being mashed up.  Each correct answer gets 1 point for whoever rings on first, but if they miss any question, the other player gets to hear 10 more seconds and has the opportunity to answer, and gets TWO points for each answer.  This is so that players don't just rush to buzz in if they recognize only one component.  First one to 10 with at least two points more than their opponent wins (kind of like volleyball scoring).

The people at the event are very unique, not just in their commonly outrageous dress (or undress) but their countenance, their demeanor, is unique to the event. Covered in dust these people have a spirit, a freedom unseen back in the \u201cdefault\u201d world. Because it is the people that create the event, it is my intention to focus on the individual. The \u201cmodels\u201d are photographed on-site, (with their written permission) and the paintings are created using these photographs  as a reference following the event. These paintings will eventually be shown in a gallery setting hopefully one which will travel the country. A book about the project is also in the works.",

Either way, we can help you pick out the perfect complement for your Playa attire, and add a custom chin strap so that your new chapeau doesn't fly away in the Playa wind to become trash fence MOOP.  Then, with your permission, we'll take a lovely photo of you sporting your fashion goodness.  Photos can be accessed later online.  And don't worry--we never post anything without asking permission first.\r\n\r\nAlso:  Do you need hemp rope for those on-Playa bondage classes?  Or to tie up (or tie down), that special Playa someone?  We have lots to give away...and we'll teach you a knot or two while we're at it.  Ask very nicely, and we may give you a suspension bondage ride, or grant you a trip to the view tower to watch the sunset.  Take a tour of our alternative energy usage and grey water recycling.

We'll run loops around the playa, traveling journeys in our mind that nothing can compete with. We'll dance with you as we run past, give out free sweaty hugs, and ask you to join us. There's still time to train, so dust off those running shoes and prepare to run what promises to be the funnest race of your life. There are competitive runners, those who are just out to have fun, and those who love the sufferfest and love. However you want to run, we have the race for you. Run with us for the race of a lifetime!\r\n\r\nFor more info, visit our website or email me with your name, gender, race date age, email address, regular address, emergency contact info for off and on the playa, and t-shirt size.\r\n\r\nVolunteers (that significant other?) are also welcome to the party of a race.\r\n\r\nGet ready to have the ultimate high: runner's high!\r\n\r\nEmail cherylish@yahoo.com and check out www.burningman50k.com and https://www.facebook.com/events/591387204233888/",

So prove it. \r\n\r\nCome on down to Camp Nimby in the BC Village at 2pm on Wednesday to join us in resurrecting this old-timey fair game  Black Rock City style. \r\n\r\nFunky beats will help move your feets as you jockey for position on one of the numbered place-mats (think musical chairs). Numbers will be drawn and if you find yourself on the winning place-mat, you win! Piece of cake! \r\n\r\nThere will be many chances to win but a cake-thirsty attitude is strongly recommended. No one said this would be a cake walk! (wait...)\r\n\r\nWe can't wait to see you pastry fiends converge on our humble camp.  This event will literally take the cake!",

Move through the energies of groundedness, sexuality, energy regulation, open hearted love, creative expression, pattern recognition, and divine connection. In this workshop, you will learn how to use the moves and practice principles of Hoop Dance to bring your life into alignment at each chakra level so you feel more balanced and happier.

The squares will all have different quests written on them that need to be completed in a certain timeframe, or players have to go back to the previous square of the same color.

You've seen feats of skill on the Playa, and who hasn't dreamed of running off to join the Circus. Heck, half of y'all probably still dream in acrobats and clowns. At Circus Boot Camp, we'll teach you to juggle, unicycle, hoop, slack line, trapeze, crack a whip and indulge your childish fancy in other circus-inspired arts. I know what you're thinking: \"Sure, you'll teach me to juggle... after I've spent years on the road washing elephants and dodging monkey poop!\" Wrong! Our goal is nothing less than to bring the joys of object manipulation, unicycling and other circus arts to the Playa masses in a casual, friendly and fully clothed environment (ok, mostly-clothed). Already a circus pro? Come test your mettle on our slackline; dance your clown shoes through the obstacles of irony; pass clubs with seasoned semi-professionals; try your hand at the Valley of One-Wheeled Doom!!",

The process works by subconsciously shifting your decision making over the next 10 years eventually making your vision a reality.\r\n\r\nYou don't know what that day looks like? Don't worry, most people don't, but your subconscious already knows what is important to it.  The more amazing and compelling the vision that you let emerge, the more you will be drawn to it. \r\n\r\nHow? Most people make between 80 to 400 decisions a day. A rich, compelling visualization with a lot of sensory \"hooks\" can shift those decisions towards your perfect future because the right choices will feel \"right\". \r\n\r\nWe will start with a mindfulness of breath meditation, a gratitude exercise and then wake up the morning of your perfect day and explore it through a guided process.  After, we will ask a few of those interested to share their visualization with the group.\r\n\r\nWe look forward to sharing your future day together.\r\n\r\nDr.Feelgood",

While we can\u2019t escape the loud dance music in the morning, many dayburners (burners who are more focus on the daytime activities) are seeking solitude at the dawn of the day. NYC director/composer Dayburn (Charlie Wan) will be performing his original cinematic score at Black Rock Observatory (designed by 2013 Temple designer Gregg Fleishman) to accompany your deep connecting moment with the most important star in our universe - the Sun. There will be live visual projection of the sun from solar telescope by astrophysicist Matt O'Dowd. Any art cars with sound systems and FM radio receivers are welcomed to participate our additional immersive simulcast soundscape experience. There will be a small numbers of radio receivers available to be borrowed at the event. The concert starts at the first ray of light on friday morning (August 29, 6am).

While we can\u2019t escape the loud dance music in the morning, NYC director/composer Charlie Dayburn composed a 7-track Original cinematic soundtrack to accompany dayburners like us who are seeking solitude at the dawn of the day. The 7 tracks express 7 roller coaster feelings throughout the week. Charlie Dayburn would like to share the whole album with fellow dayburners through 7 different connection exercises from body contact to soul gazing. This album is also tuned to 432Hz which believes it's the vibrational frequency of our human bodies. It's an more inward experience that is felt inside the body at the spine and heart. Each attendee will receive a copy of the album.",

With Guided mediations we learn how to use voice and story to guide the body and mind into complete relaxation. When we're on the playa there are so many things going through our heads and we need to quiet the mind and feel grounded to start the day and eventually focus on our intentions while out in the desert.\r\n\r\nIn Individual guided meditation with Bobby Hedglin Taylor everyone will learn how to follow a guided meditation and experience relaxation on a deep subconscious level to shake off the every day cares and woes! You'll leave with the tools to create your own meditations and those used in class will be gifted to you to use back in the muggle world via youtube. :) You're also welcome to record the meditations we use in class to use again and again!\r\n\r\nI can't promise enlightenment or nirvana, but I can promise a great, peaceful hour on the playa and take you to another world of deep relaxation!\r\n\r\nNamaste\r\n\r\nBobby Hedglin Taylor\r\n\r\nSee also https://www.facebook.com/events/781521991887385/?ref=4#",

The exterior is iconically shaped like a giant cartoon speech bubble with the word \u2018TRUTH\u2019 printed on the side. The interior acts much like a photo booth, but serves to compile 2 minute long video responses from the public. Once seated inside people are invited to record their opinions and thoughts as they finish the statement: \u201cThe truth is...\u201d. \r\n\r\nThroughout this long-term project the video footage will be compiled and edited into a video installation. To expand and engage with audiences, the movements of The Truth Booth and sample responses will also be tracked, edited, and categorised on a dedicated website. Ultimately, the goal of this project is to try to capture as many definitions, confessions and thoughts on The Truth as possible, creating a diverse \u2018portrait\u2019 of people across the globe. \r\n\r\nThe Cause Collective is a team of artists, designers and ethnographers creating innovative art in the public realm. Their projects explore and enliven public spaces by creating a dynamic conversation between issues, sites and the public audience. By exploring ideas that affect and shape society, they seek to add the \u2018public\u2019 back into public space and art.",

The 2009 version of this event won the Acculturation Video award from Burning Man (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtX8Z-izffs\\).

Laughter is simulated as a body exercise in a group; with eye contact and childlike playfulness, it soon turns into real and contagious laughter. \u201cInappropriate\u201d Laughter Yoga is also a possibility, if our clientele are okay with it. The concept of Laughter Yoga is based on a scientific fact that the body cannot differentiate between fake and real laughter. One gets the same physiological and psychological benefits.

This shift brings the capacity for continuing our personal and social transformation.\r\n-\tI propose living fully human as the cosmos personifying as a viable spiritual meta-orientation. This would mean we intellectually, emotionally, perceptually recognize ourselves as the totality and as unique expressions of Universe. We are not separate from the Universe or each other, rather we are the Whole uniquely manifesting as these dynamic human forms. From this recognition, we shift our behavior individually and collectively to align with this deep insight into our identity. The workshop will introduce this framework and guide participants to practice, awaken, and sustain their unique cosmic embodiment for the sake of the Whole.",

Come for an early hour of low impact exercise in the Longevity Stick Art (LSA) discipline of 12 low-impact exercises to build balance, flexibility, strength, mental focus, breathing capacity, and vitality, and open your points and channels. Bring your water or hydration liquid. We\u2019ll have sticks available for you. Master Mai Bac Dao developed the Longevity Stick Art discipline while he was a prisoner of war of the North Vietnamese Army. He helped his fellow prisoners restore and maintain their health through LSA, and vowed that if he was ever freed, he would dedicate his life to spreading its benefits to the world, with the proviso that no future trainer could ever charge for the course. (Sounds like \"gifting,\" eh?) He was freed, settled in Southern California, and started teaching classes of students and future teachers. Today, there are dozens of classes weekly around So Cal. Also, LSA is spreading around the US and world. Many more details are available at: www.longevitystick.org/Longevitystick.org/Home.html and www.filmbaby.com/films/2341 Master Dao passed away late 2010 at age 89, and one of our camp was privileged to attend his funeral, and his last birthday party, a few months before.",

In presenting these issues, we are asked to consider misplaced notions of \u201cdisposability\u201d, calling in to question consumer driven waste which has devalued what is in fact a very important material.\r\n\r\nParticipate: Make a Fish\r\n\r\nExplore the Marine Food Web by drawing or painting a marine creature. A large array of fish, crustaceans, birds and mammals all make up the web and are all affected by chemical body burdens represented here by plastic. Think of how you can incorporate re-purposed material into your creature. This way, we can make use of that which is normally disposed of without second thought.\r\n\r\nSend a .jpg of your piece to gallery420@gmail.com.\r\nIn doing so, you will be releasing your creature into the \u201cocean\u201d.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe images are transferred onto repurposed materials like foamcore and are used as the base of interactive installations.These installations are set up in educational institutions and gallery exhibitions. Through the installation, people may learn about how we contribute directly to this problem, even if we live inland, and how we are directly impacted through the chemical body burdens we carry. Participants are introduced to solutions on how to reduce exposure to chemicals in their own lives and how to lessen the environmental impacts from the source.\r\nSimilar to the processing of material in the actual ocean, images will be replicated, transferred, redistributed, distressed, and reworked as the instillation is plugged into educational programming and handled by participants. \r\n\r\nhttp://virtualvoices.org/plastic",

Grounding is a vital component of daily balanced living. It allows us to deepen our connection with mother earth, or Gaia, and source energy. It teaches us how to release stress, stay focused, clear the chatter from our minds and auric fields, and eliminate free radicals from our bodies. When we connect with Gaia, we begin to realize that we are all safe and well provided for. We learn to understand our greater truths and to let go of fear, anger, guilt and anxiety. This allows us to establish a connection with our divine authentic self. Whether you are a seasoned meditator or novice, you are invited to experience an ancient Eastern meditation breathing technique that has been passed on from master to master for centuries to achieve self-enlightenment. In this workshop you will learn about the chakra system, with an emphasis on the root, sacral and solar plexus. Our chakras govern our life force energy as well as our glandular, mental and emotional systems. Through the use of sage, crystals and sound we will also start to understand basic cleansing of our auric field and our surroundings. We will utilize ancient grounding techniques and a guided meditation to establish our connection with Gaia, help transform our outlook, and feel more grounded in our everyday lives.",

However during my training to become a psychotherapist, not only did I learn how to \"name-it\", but I learned how empowering it was to do so, and my relationships and life has improved as a consequence.

I, the facilitator, used to find it very difficult to have those difficult conversations we have to have with romantic partners, friends work colleagues and so forth.  However during my training to become a psychotherapist, not only did I learn how to \"name-it\", but I learned how empowering it was to do so, and my relationships and life has improved as a consequence.  As a result I want to gift the playa some of the skills I have learnt by offering a series of \"Naming-it\"workshops, so I can make becoming a better communicating easy and fun. So please join me and come \"name-it\".",

Some of those tools are especially applicable when working with Ayahuasca. She will share some useful tools that can maximize our experience, as well as what we can learn, in those inner voyages. Non- ordinary states of consciousness can come with their own sets of 'superpowers', operating principles and potential pitfalls. Knowing how to use those forces for expansion, and alignment, can not only occasionally save you from 'the inner gates of hell', but also bring accelerated growth, ecstatic experiences, and a deep feeling of connectedness with yourself, others, and the world.",

Yes, the Orgasamator is returning to the Camp for Sensual Pleasures, in Spanky's Village.  The Orgasmatron had been a fixture at Burning Man for many years, giving thousands of women exceptional physical pleasure in an environment that was safe, comfortable, sensual and private.  Four years ago we took everything we had learned from it, completely redesigned the machine for even greater intensity and enjoyment, and we gave it a new name: The Orgasamator.  Development has continued with a singular goal of maximizing sensuality, along with our guests\u2019 overall pleasure and comfort.  When you visit, you will be in a private room with an operator who is experienced, very sensitive to your needs and concerns, who listens well and is deeply dedicated to giving you an amazing experience.  You will leave feeling refreshed and respected.  Come solo, or better yet, bring a good friend (male or female) to add another dimension to this deeply immersive and wonderfully personal experience.  You can wear as much or as little as you would like while riding this marvelous machine, you can stop any time if the pleasure becomes too intense, and no penetration is involved. If you are a woman, the Orgasamator Experience at our I-Scream Parlour is something you won't want to miss.

At last, a retreat where the aural options are in keeping with the indigenous stillness and aesthetics of the Black Rock Desert. It will provide shade and shelter to weary travelers who might require a bit of tranquility and quiet in order to recharge and allow them to commune with their internal and external environments. The Otic Way is an arc of individual Satellites with a central Shade area, composed of geometric crystalline clusters of interwoven modules, that provide individualized and group spaces for meditation and contemplation of the sunrise, sunset and our natural surroundings. The biomimicry of the design complements the desert backdrop and offers a manmade structure that takes inspiration from the rocks, mountains, caves, and plateaus found in nature. It is made completely of interlocking wood, with no nails or metal fasteners.",

Then join us at Camp Beaverton in our Beaver Dome for this workshop. We will open with heartfelt sharing about our relationships with masturbation, address the stigmas faced in society, and open ourselves to understanding why and how we pleasure ourselves. Once we are all comfortable, we will start exploring our bodies. We will keep our hands to ourselves and power up our bullets, magic wands, rabbits, or other fun battery operated toys. We will not be able to provide much AC power for the Hitachi\u2019s so if you have an extra generator - please bring it to help charge up those in need! Safe sex supplies like lube, gloves, hand sanitizer, and condoms will be available. Cum take a ride with us! Women/Transfolks only please.",

There, Terence McKenna, Jonathan Ott, Ann & Sasha Shulgin, and a host of other psychedelic luminaries passed along many insights, discoveries, and wild tales to the fortunate Tribe members who were there. And it was at the end of the pool where Terence McKenna gave some of his last talks at the Chan Kah.\r\n\r\nYears later, then in 2003, a few alumni from those conferences decided to have a \"Palenque reunion\" at the Burning Man Festival, and so they organized a lecture series to continue the Palenque tradition.",

We then dispense our \"Tiki Punch\" (yes, it has a punch) well into the night. Party Naked Tiki Bar is the clothing optional bar that rewards your getting naked. This year we have 1500+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\". Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We will also have activities scheduled for fun at the bar, check out our schedule when you come by. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

The playa provides the grit, we supply the glamour so hop the K Train to costume transformations, music and a non stop runway show that would make RuPaul blush. Of course the city never sleeps and our amazing DJ line up keeps us moving into the night as the city lights shine bright into the dark playa night. Also not to be missed is the Peepshow FreaKKshow, BRC's only 24 hour participatory peep show where you can be the star or simply sneak a peek at some Big Apples! Down our alleys you will find costumes, crafting, sparkle pony vagrants, playa hustlers, burner working gals and street wise tramps. You won't want to miss it so jump the turnstile to the KKrossroads Of The World. After all if you can make it here you can make it anywhere!",

If you are convicted or found liable, you can accept her sentence, which is guaranteed to be interesting or you can try your luck at the wheel of punishment.  Or you may win your case and see your opponent subjected to Playa justice.  Either way, someone always pays!  Whatever the choice or the outcome, you can be assured of an unbalanced hearing\u2026for the Playa, that is.\r\n \r\nBring your case!  You will be heard!  Is it your noisy neighbor?  A spat with a girlfriend?  Did a campmate drink your last cold beer?  Maybe it was just your turn to drive the art car.  Whatever the dispute, our jurist will sort it out.\r\n\r\nWe will hold court twice during the week or if an emergency arises.  Join us Wednesday afternoon and Friday afternoon from 3-5 for fun, laughs, and some serious judgments and some wicked punishments.",

There are many workable forms of Polyamorous relationship - polyamory is polymorphic! There is much wisdom in the poly community which can be helpful to people trying to make *any* relationship work, monogamous or Polyamorous. There will be a facilitated discussion in which you can get your questions addressed and some of the knowledge in our community can be shared.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like to cool off and de-dust yourself after our tea party, bring a water donation to enjoy PolyParadise's famous Human Carcass Wash.",

Then separate all your aluminum cans and bring them to Recycle Camp. We are located in Center Camp at 6:00, directly behind the Cafe. The camp is \"Open\" and ready to accept your cans Monday through Sunday, 9am to 5pm. Bring your clean, separated aluminum cans only. We definitely don't want your trash. We also do not accept any other recyclables, you can take them to one of the 24 hour recycling stations on your way back to Reno, check out your Survival Guide for more information. We provide a sorting area to check your cans for anything that isn't aluminum. Then you can ride the bike powered can crusher and crush your cans. After your cans get crushed, you will put your crushed cans into the large containers at the camp. All proceeds from the aluminum are donated to the Gerlach K-12 School in Gerlach, NV.

        "description": "Come enjoy Reiki, a Japanese technique for relaxation that also promotes healing.  It's done through touch. A warm and soothing energy flows from the hands into the participant, promoting relaxation and releasing tension.  The participant  will be asked to where headphones playing ambient tones and soundscapes for the duration of session to also experience the healing of sound combined with Reiki.  Sessions can be given in 15 minutes to 1 hour depending on the participants needs.  Our Reiki healer will sit down with each participant for a short conversation before the session to allow them to connect and become absolutely comfortable with one another.  Reiki is joint practice between healer and participant.  The more open and accepting of the universal healing energy you are, the more powerful your session will be for both yourself and the healer.  So come, relax, be yourself and enjoy the gift of Reiki at Camp 88.  Love&Light always all ways.",

        "description": "Part of the magic of Burning Man is the altogether unexpected nature of what will happen. For one week, we step outside of our usual selves, finding God in a phone booth, discovering your true authentic self in the eyes of clown on whip-its, or stumbling upon the Barbie Death Camp and Wine Bistro.\r\n\r\nBut, all this novelty can be a strain on your relationship. Once you combine it with the heat, dehydration, strange substances, strange food and even stranger campmates, your previously lovely and wonderful partner may seem to have turned into some sort of dusty alien. A dusty alien you can barely stand.\r\n\r\nFortunately, you can avoid a visit to the Costco Soulmate Trading Outlet with a bit of preparation and foresight. In this workshop, led by open relationship coach and multiple-Burn veteran Marcia Baczynski, you\u2019ll find out everything you need for your relationship to not only survive, but thrive, at Burning Man. We\u2019ll cover:\r\n\r\nYour #1 secret weapon for avoiding fights on the playa (especially those really, really stupid ones)\r\n- The real reason the Burn makes or breaks relationships\r\n- What to do when you have different ideas of what \u201cfun at Burning Man\u201d means\r\n- A quick and easy way to get the most out of your time together -- and apart\r\n- Simple and practical steps you can take now to make your Burn together the best one ever\r\n\r\nPlus, you\u2019ll walk out with your own personalized guide for staying connected, getting what you both need and having a blast during your time in the dust.\r\n\r\nWhether you\u2019re a virgin burner or going home yet again, join us for a hilarious and practical workshop that will help you make sure you get to enjoy your camp, your costumes and your favorite co-conspirators.\r\n\r\nBecause \u201cgoing to the Burn\u201d shouldn\u2019t mean \u201csitting in a hot tent processing.\u201d",

Imagine if it gave us a vision and a reality of what it means to make a whole different society and a whole differentkind of world. Imagine if it laid out the problems for people in making this kind of world and challenged them to take upthese problems. Imagine if art and culture too\u2014movies, songs, television, everything\u2014challenged people to think critically, tolook at things differently, to see things in a different light, but all pointing toward how can we make a better world.Imagine if the people who created art and culture were not just a handful of people but all of the masses of people, withall their creative energy unleashed, and the time were made for them to do that, and for them to join with people whoare more full-time workers and creators in the realm of art and culture to bring forward something new that wouldchallenge people, that would make them think in different ways, that would make them be able to see things criticallyand from a different angle, and would help them to be uplifted and help them to see their unity with each otherand with people throughout the world in putting an end to all the horrors that we\u2019re taught are just the naturalorder of things.

        "description": "\"What is Rootism?\" My response to this in short: Rootism is a belief that the truth of our learned existence lies in the Roots of all teachings/truths and beliefs. These truths are different for everyone based on how they we raised and what we resonate with at the time of our learning. As a Rootist, we take the roots of various truths and incorporate them into our own mantra, our own way of living, to become the well rounded person that we wish to be. When you resonate with more than one truth, you are a Rootist. There are many different types of Rootist's. You could be a Christian Rootist, a Buddhist Rootist, or any type of Rootist. The moment you resonate with more than one truth & take the roots of those teachings as your truths, you become a Rootist.\r\n\r\nRootism is a lesson that I have learned and come to resonate with over the last few years. I am grateful to share this information with each of you. Please feel free to share this with anyone with whom you feel might be interested.\r\n\r\nAs an offset of Rootism, we have The Rootist's Way. A style of yoga that is in-tentful in it's design and sequences to help to facilitate a certain type of energy clearing and calling in of new energies.\r\n\r\nThank you for reading this and for wanting to know more about Rootism.\r\n\r\nThe 8 Principles of Rootism:\r\n\r\n\u221ePrinciples of Rootism\u2122\r\n\r\n1. Release what no longer serves - nurture yourself & ground yourself\r\n2. Embrace a Creative Vision\r\n3. Move forward on your journey -Take Steps Fearlessly\r\n4. Empathize and Feel what is going on within you & others\r\n5. Motivate yourself & others by Truth \u2013 Check the Ecology of the Whole\r\n6. Bridge the Mind & the Heart\r\n7. Evolve a Pro-Sociality Lifestyle & Manifest a Greater Humanity - help others and give back\r\n8. Revolutionize - Reveal Yourself! Open UP! Inner Knowing is Outer Showing\r\n\r\nThe acronym is \"Remember\"",

There has been much ado lately in the media and in our lives around words like Tranny, bitch, dyke, slut, cunt, queer, gender queer, tranimal, pussy, fag, ratchet, diva, queen, king, and the list goes on. This workshop will explore what words we use to identify, where those words come from, how words impact us, how words can both hurt us and heal us. This is designed to be a workshop for people of all backgrounds. This workshop will be a safe space for people from all perspectives on these words and all identities to explore these words and the impact they have on us. This will be a time for people to share stories of hurt and sorrow, liberation and joy and to be seen and honored in these stories. The same word that hurts one, might heal another. In this space we request open hearts and minds as we dialogue about this sensitive topic of identity, oppression, reclaiming words, creating words, and living into what these words mean. All genders, races, classes, identities, bodies are welcome and honored always.",

        "description": "The workshop is an ultra-condensed form of a type of massage developed by the Body Electric School. It combines breathwork and a sequence of erotic massage techniques which stimulate erotic energy but don\u2019t expend it in ejaculation. The result is often a heightened erotic state some people call a \u201cfull body orgasm.\"\r\nIn the Body Electric workshops, these techniques are learned over a two-day weekend workshop which explores intimacy, eroticism, and personal growth.  Here, we\u2019ve got two hours. So, we learn a shortened version just of the massage part, and change the rules a little bit: partners just work on one another, and the massage is a bit shorter. However, as past participants can tell you (and hopefully will in the comments!), the workshops are incredibly powerful, hot (in all senses of the word\u2026), and, for some, deeply healing and transformative. A lot of guys who have done the Burning Man workshop have gone on to do Body Electric, and integrated these new forms of eroticism into their own lives.\r\nA few guiding principles if you\u2019re thinking of coming to the workshop:\r\n- This is a hands-on, clothes-off workshop.  Spectators are not allowed.  You will have an opportunity to opt-out before the massage begins.\r\n- We will be doing one round of massage, so each person will either give or receive.  Note that giving can often be more powerful than receiving.\r\n- Givers of massage may be of any sex and gender.  We\u2019ll be teaching the massage techniques for male bodies (i.e. people with penises).  However, the main part of the practice is not the massage but the energy and breathwork, so female-bodied people are more than welcome to participate!\r\n- Bring a towel and water\r\n- Pee ahead of time\r\n- Bring purell.  We provide massage lotion",

Half a century later, human civilization still finds itself poised on the edge of social and ecological annihilation. The psychedelic experience, like much of the exotic infusions that shaped the consciousness of the 60s, has been all too easily appropriated by consumer capitalism, transformed into just another gimmick to satisfy our addiction to instant gratification. This talk will explore an alternative, alchemical interpretation of such experiences that serves to undermine the sort of ecologically and politically alienated mode of consciousness that continues to perpetuate capitalist social relations. Psychedelics are an invitation to re-imagine what it means to be human beings.",

Assembly at the Fandango bar to get good & liquored up, we will then proceed to invade the most pretentious, principle disregarding camps on the playa. Scout out the most severe offenders to target for invasion, such as first camp. Super-special bonus prize for whomever locates this years manifestation of Zoo Camp (hint: it's a boner). Radical inclusion? Let's see how committed they are to this premise! Attention all the animals of the night - whores, skunk pussies, buggers, queens, fairies, dopers, junkies, sick, venal. Time has come for a real rain to wash all this scum off the streets.",

        "description": "Vines Without Borders (Vines) is a global wine bar and lounge inviting guests and wines from around the world to convene for an unforgettable burn. Whether you\u2019re an enophile (lover of wine) or a neophile (lover of new things) Vines is the first \u2018port of call\u2019 on your Caravansary journey. Our inviting venue features a lively lounge furnished with vintage couches and chairs, illuminated with LED lighting, showcasing a sleek LED back-lit bar designed and built especially for this burn. The Vines international wine theme is our unifying principle for global community and festivity. We will craft an intimate, interactive experience that provides opportunity for people from everywhere to drop in and enjoy discovering others on a deeper level, making connections that survive beyond the week. Our desire to connect stems from experience with our previous Camp Dawdle where we offered adventure rides on the Wheel of Passage. Guests loved the randomness and fun of the wheel rides, gave many thank-you hugs, but quickly moseyed on their merry way. It was unfortunately a fleeting interaction model. We felt we met many great souls but didn\u2019t get to know any of them. With our new Vines concept, we increase our \u2018stickyness\u2019 with a cool wine lounge and an emphasis on international guests. Our wine focus and casual setting invites conversation while unavoidable language barriers ensure focused interaction, commitment to the moment and ultimately greater intimacy. Vines will bring together burners from around the world to make global connections around a unifying theme of wine.  In the spirit of Caravansary we will be a multicultural hub of interaction and wine sharing. We\u2019ll enjoy the melody of world languages spoken throughout our camp and across our bar. Of course, we\u2019ll also howl at our own grammatical gaffes while we resort to hand waving to articulate our most earnest points. What we\u2019ll enjoy most will surely be the communion of the raised wine glass as we toast one another.",

Have you ever wanted to learn to better work with this phenomena to improve your well being?\r\n\r\nIn this workshop we will explore various postures, practices, movements and meditations that aim at awakening and influencing the subtle channels of energy in the body. What are the subtle channels in the body? What is the function and purpose of working with the subtle energy? \r\n\r\nLearning to pay attention more closely to the subtle energy flow in our bodies during our yoga practices can begin to open our awareness in ways we couldn't, when we just focused on the gross body. We will work on developing an awareness of subtle energy and then explore various theoretical models we can apply in our practice to positively transform our body, mind and deepen our yoga journey.",
