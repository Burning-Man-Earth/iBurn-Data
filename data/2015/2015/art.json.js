The branching head area of the sculpture serves as a playful interactive space where participants can become literal neurotransmitters providing the necessary synaptic activation for the piece to come alive. Lighting elements with proximity awareness sensors responding to the movements of participants as they move through the piece will add an additional element to the piece at nite. The sculpture as a whole emanates a contemplative yet engaging quality. Our hope is to create a safe environment for participants to engage in a playful and intimate experience.",

So people will have to come together, and support each other getting up and down. The stage like situation invites burners to interact and play with the environment, slip into the role of a child or a lilliput and with their own body, experience a different concept of size. In the presence of the giant table and chairs, the viewer will feel physically diminished and will be returned to the experiences of childhood adventure.\nThe sensation of being thrown off balance by the striking discrepancies in the scale of this setting is an invitation for people to think about  existing structures in the default world",

It plays with the literal reflections created by mirrored facets and provokes personal and inward reflection. The intriguing outer walls resemble ornate Chinese folding screens. Once inside Burners will find a mysterious mirrored crystalline sculpture which will reflect their crazy decorated bodies in its multiple facets and encourage spontaneous and uninhibited performances. The tattoo imagery of the intricately laser-cut petal walls is inspired by the magnificent Tattooed Ladies of the early 20th Century Travelling Carnivals. The ‘skin’ of the Cirque celebrates these Ladies as early pioneers of Radical Self Expression. It reminds us that our bodies are our personal canvas and how we paint, ink, pierce and decorate them, clothe and conceal them, flaunt and expose them, remains our own very personal choice. Elegant mirrored images of contortionists in the lower panels also celebrate the marvels of the human body.",

        "description": "Just as we are a sect of homo-sapiens which grows lush in our desert habitat, one imagines that everything about our city - the striped tents, the night beacons, the strange crawling vehicles, the unexpected flames - are equally living products of the rare atmosphere of the playa. One imagines what creatures might evolve there in the heat and the dust, with the sun and the wind for power, with a peacock's urges to be admired day and night, with a joy in the solitude and the rough edges of the natural world that spawned them. What life forms might develop as the denizens of the Carnival of Mirrors if their constituent molecules were dust and rust and sunlight? \n\nAn answer to this question is The Dancing Serpent which will be a 14 foot long sculptural metal serpent constructed as a mobile. Canvas sails hang from the serpent to catch the wind, causing the sculpture to swim gracefully through the air, and propane flames sprout from an array of outlets along its spine and jaws.",

        "description": "DESERT SIRENS. Three female mannequins standing under a canopy supported by artificial palm trees are an inviting oasis, luring in Burners with their perfect model bodies. As viewers first approach the art work, motion sensors trigger a haunting sound track of seductive voices, whispers, singing and music, entreating them to come closer.  As viewers get closer, individual sound tracks play, sometimes seductive but more often derogatory and dismissive, or demanding or needy. And intermittently, cool water misters emit from their nipples.\n\nThe inspiration for this sculpture is the Odysseus legend of the Sirens, who bewitched any sailor that got too close and led them to death.\n\nThis art work embodies these contradictions of the exceptionally attractive woman who continue to both lure and repulse men and women. It seeks to provoke discussions about gender politics surrounding these rare subset of the human species. Attractive and yet perilous. Impossible to resist, but dangerous to posses",

The classic video game tetris is played on a board blown up to epic proportions. Each square of the board is a steel box open at the front, creating a grid. The tetris pieces descending down this metal grid are rendered in flame, courtesy of 200 flame effect heads. \n\nIn addition to the traditional single player mode, Fire Tetris can be played with four participants in multiplayer mode. Each player controls one aspect of the piece’s movement: left, right, rotate, and drop. While video games can be an isolating pursuit, this dramatic, highly visible metal monolith encourages cooperative play as well as appreciation from a larger audience while participants ANNIHILATE BLOCKS WITH FIRE.",

Traditionally, a kaleidoscope is a triangular prism, comprised of mirrors with loose beads or pieces of glass held at the end opposite the eye hole.  When rotated, the moving pieces create colourful patterns with an effect that is absolutely mesmerizing.  Our intention is to give the viewer that same feeling of awe, as when they first looked through that tiny eyehole as a child.\n\nThis kaleidoscope has been scaled up to eleven feet long and the colourful beads have been replaced with colourful humans.  The scope manually rotates within a cradle at a height people can easily look through and even climb inside.  Lights around the openings frame the image, accentuating the triangulated pattern and provide a brilliant invitation to explore.  Everyone becomes an integral part of the interactive experience - Voyeurs become participants and the adventurous become part of the world within.",

The piece at its core is a delicately-patterned piece of art that can be safely experienced hands-on and visually via distorted reflections from mirror pieces.\n\nThe structure resembles an archway from certain angles and colorful reflective spokes coming out of the playa from others.",

Its dark, deeply textured exterior surrounds a bright, reflective interior, into which one may venture through its toothy jaws. Elevated over its open head is a halo of silver bird-fish which dance and spin. Flame effects and undulating lights enliven this mysterious beast, and invite the participant to rest on its fins, gather inside, and sneak through its gills. The Illumacanth is a free-standing, interactive sculptural installation made primarily of metal. It provides seating and gathering space, and features flame and light effects as well as kinetic elements.",

How much can you say with not so many words?  Some messages will be inspired, some will be dumb; we hope for surprises.  The emphasis is on interactive creation, rather than passive viewing.\nPhysically, the installation is a large tray (8' high, 40' long)  that can hold letters about 2 feet high, and be easily reconfigured, ideally at hour intervals.  The installation will be illuminated at night with blacklight.  Truly interactive art is rare on the playa, and this is an attempt at total interactivity; Burners themselves become micro-poets.",

The swirling colors and sounds of the playa just beyond the colorful paths and flags of the labyrinth make a backdrop for the fascinating panoply of creativity on the playa. Within the labyrinth, participants find a calm center, a space for musing and meditation, or a peaceful moment of At-Onement. In a magical box at the base of a large Cleu, participants may find a clue to their own lives or even be led to CleuCamp where they can get a Cleu brainwashing and copper Cleu pendant.

        "description": "The Light Striker Trial of Strength project is primarily inspired by the high striker game, which is most common to the circus sideshow and carnival setting.  The Light Strikers will stand at an imposing but approachable 10 feet tall and will vary in form.  Lighting will be embedded into the forms on hierarchical levels activated through the main track of the striker.  The ball struck by the force of the lever will trigger switches to these lights, so that if the ball is struck to the top of the Light Striker then all the lighting on the form will be activated.\n    The main interactive component is the high striker mechanism.  Attention is focused on the person wielding the hammer, and the blow that lands causes an primal spike of energy which emanates upwards and outwards.  The goal of the Trials is to create a shared space of luminosity and exuberance on the playa. This would create a harmonizing space where and people can share these experiences and also forge new friendships.",

Traditions of Tantra claim that meditation can clear blockages at each \"chakra\", thus permitting Kundalini to rise up the spine to the crown of the head.\n\nThis piece is inspired by the vintage arcade cabinet, \"Love Tester\", where a grip is squeezed, causing a stack of rainbow light bulbs to rise, to a level supposedly indicating one's aptitude as a lover. Rather than trying to raise the lights toward Kundalini and enlightenment, participants will try to extinguish the lights, top-down, in an attempt to quell their desires and quieten their mind.",

In the center (the heart of the heart), dwells a geometric jungle gym, that rotates under human power, while the 3-tier base supports the structure with minimal \nimpact to the Playa (no holes!). METAHEART is about discovery. Exploration reveals different aspects of the geometry, as the shape appears to change depending on \nthe viewpoint. Interaction brings the sculpture to life, as its sub-powered heartbeat keeps pace with its rotating centerpiece. At night there is more to discovered.Computer-driven LEDs pulsate to the beat, and 3 red lasers, each at a 33 degree angle atop the sculpture, sweep in synchronization. A next level of audio-reactive \nlight shows is unlocked only by the proximity of a sufficiently loud art car.",

As the sole remaining structure of this ghost town, the chapel captures the pilgrims’ peculiar affinity for worshiping the wind and the beautiful mysteries this silent force creates on the open plain. Twin copper wind harps flank the canvas chapel, enticing lost travelers with a dreamy siren song.  Towering over the altar is a 40 ft. steel windmill which pumps a Victorian reed organ and two wood and metal pipe organs. Evoking the melancholic demise of the wind worshiping Aeolians, modern pilgrims can play three wind-powered keyboards, filling the restored chapel with the ephemeral sounds of yesterday.

This is an abstract conceptual image of a giant tear drop frozen in the position at the point it impacts water. The peak of the structure reaches 20' tall by 42' wide in diameter.The scale represents the tears people left on earth shed when someone takes their own life.The drop combines with a snowflake, then creating dimensional angels to represent the unique   individuality of each person.The octagon footprint creates a fungshui feeling.A rainbow of stairs surround the center tower, representing the peaks and valleys of life. Inside the portal entry is a chakra of color. Second story window seats can be climbed up on, to look out from a higher view.Music played inside will all be of a vibration of the 432 or 528hz frequency creating a vibrational healing chamber amplified with crystals.",

By providing an interactive base for participation Reflection is never fully accomplished without the burners involvement. By sharing their stories, burners create a unique experience manifested through the ideals of trust and sharing, which facilitates a special bond between the burners. Upon its burning at the end of the festival, ‘Reflection’ becomes a resting place for the confessions, secrets and stories of its burners, allowing new bonds to be formed.",

Over the stretch fabric, we will attach 80 6.5ft (1\" diameter) acrylic tubes to the skeleton. These will make the spines of the sea urchin. LED strips will run through the acrylic tubes which will make the sea urchin glow. This would also allow the wind to move the spines to give it a natural kinetic animation.\n\nInside the sea urchin, there will be a chandelier at the center point creating an great visual effect. Once the Sea Urchin senses people inside, the 1,500 programmable LEDs running through the translucent spines will react to human activity through motion detection sensors.\n\nWe'll also have motion sensors to control the lights for extra interactivity.",

Simon, as a memory game, is by definition a test of skill and meets the Principle of Radical Inclusion by being easily accessible by its basis as a childrens’ game.  The principles of Interactivity and Immediacy are met by a flame effect game.  That is, the sculpture is animated by Interactivity and rewards the participant with immediate gratification proportional to the interaction, setting up a virtuous cycle.  What the original game lacks, this project delivers: a win-condition with lighting, sound and flame effect display.  Bluntly, we feel that a game of Simon within the “Carnival of Mirrors” theme with a light, sound and flame effect display is a winning combination.",

Familiar because the first attempt, only 10' tall was attacked by arson in 2007, only to return to the playa in 2008 this time three times bigger and still in-progress, again in 2009 carved and finished and standing in a distinctive, rambling pedestal, more like a pyre. \n\nThe majestic sculpture becomes eerie, as flames begin slowly consuming her from INSIDE her chest until the flames roar! The hole gets bigger as the sculpture hollows from the passionate Fire Inside her! The fire is extinguished before the sculpture looses structure. Later the delicate char textures will be hardened in a special finishing process developed especially for this all new fire art form. \n\nThe curious playa artifact will be shared in default from Decomps to public showings as far and wide as possible!\n\nCome, watch her burn, starting at sunset Tuesday night; or in the case of high winds, Wednesday, sunset...",

The house up close, is comprised of human souls that make up the mortar and stone. As the house crumbles, these spirits are set free. The piece conveys escape, release and regrowth. It's a visual essay on the theme of entrapment and freedom. As we travel through human life, we are broken down and destroyed.  This loss enables us to re-create ourselves so we can transform into different type of being. The wall is a bright green, patinaed by desert sun, and the figures will blossom out of the firmament to tell their own haunted stories.\n\nThe house is a place of security which is now lost. It's haunted by the lives that have resided there. As the dwelling crumbles, the freed souls flee into the new haven of the desert which is  its own trap.  This cycle of human life is our constant quest for that one 'Soul Refuge'.  (sole refuge)",

Trading grandeur for spectacle, a fire organ adds a visual and physical component to what is normally an auditory experience.\n\nSound and Fury comprises a single rank of 37 pipes (three octaves) and a piano keyboard. The piece functions as a harmonium or reed organ, using propane as the working gas in place of air. Participants will play the keyboard which will send MIDI (Musical Instrument Digital Interface) commands to the controller to open the valve for the corresponding note, resulting in musical jets of flame. The flame effects controller understands a commonly used protocol for electronic instruments so there is also an opportunity for participants to bring their own compatible devices to plug in and play with fire.",

        "description": "A Temple's purpose is to provide a safe space where the diverse and essential needs of the soul can take root and grow or surrender and find solace. This year, the Temple of Promise welcomes participants through an archway soaring 97 feet overhead. Once inside, the structure curves in on itself, tapering in width and height down to just 7 feet tall. Along the way, alcoves formed by the supporting arches, as well as wooden sculptures reminiscent of stones in a stream, create altars and semi-private spaces for individuals and smaller gatherings. The lines of the curved wooden walls draw the eye inward and create a canvas for written messages and mementos. As the path continues to curve, it opens into the contemplative altar and the heart of the Temple: a grove of three sculpted trees. The branches are initially bare. Participants will write messages on long strips of cloth and attach them to the trees, creating the gentle shade of Weeping Willows, increasing as the week progresses.",

Electronic circuitry, motion sensor lighting, audio, flame effects, and post-apocalyptic elements combine to immerse the participant in a sensory experience that is unsettling and invokes primal urges.  The majority of participants will experience the project by simply passing it by; deeper levels of interaction will be experienced by those who choose to interact physically with the piece.  The viewer can choose to interact with the piece physically…or simply take the social cues and avoid the more interactive elements; this choice replicates the everyday choices we make in our social interactions, causing the viewer to rethink how they interpret the boundaries that are frequently crossed in our lives.",

The edges are defined by LED lights that animate, illuminate, colorize and will interact and change colors in a dazzling display. Visitors can access the Jewel on a modified mechanic's creeper for a unique perspective.\n\nFlanking the Crown Jewel are two 15-foot tall “solitaires” — simple steel frames wrapped with thousands of feet of day-glow twine that creates an airy web of bright color in the day and glows brilliantly at night. The jewels will be lit by black light floods.\n\nAngular shapes allow visitors to sit and stare or lean and gaze as they interact and enjoy the jewels.",

Whispering, softly a whisper becomes a murmur, gently a murmur becomes a sound before the faintest of echoes can be heard, it begins. At first a drop, motionless. Weeks pass, slowly, a drop becomes a trickle, trickling, creeping, a journey begins, weaving, the trickle meanders. With time it grows, a small stream flows, filling the cracks of the playa. A sapling emerges, twisting and winding it grows high above the ground, encircling itself, entwining itself. A figure of our memories, a myriad of our existence, its infinitude transcends time and like the stream to the tree we breathe life into the playa. A rest for our minds, a shelter for our bodies, a place not only to remember, a place to never forget. The Infinity Tree is symbol of what can never be lost, what will always be found, and what makes us who we are.",

The sculpture also is an identity crisis for the maker who was born to the islands, but not of the islands. This effigy blends love for the culture with the abstraction of disassociation. The primary building material is steel with accents of repurposed materials finding their way into the sculpture.  Common silverware becomes teeth and ceremonial embellishments. The focus of the piece becomes the intricate and unique patterns that are accustomed to native Polynesian tattoo and wood cut patterns. Lit with a lava red glow at night the tiki becomes active and spits fire into the air in homage of the great mountain volcanos that created the island chain. The under laying resonance of the piece tries to deal with the loss of Hawaiian culture on the island and the commercialization of its resources.",

The possibilities of combinations are limitless. . . a cluster of fish eggs tucked into the ceiling, a parasitic mass pulsing to the music.\nWhen i design a site specific art piece i consider concepts like  topography, climate, etc. Meaning “cluster” in French, Touffe can take on many forms depending on the geography, architecture, local flora, etc.",

The piece was built in a manner to evoke both biological and mechanical elements, and is modeled as a hybrid between a Phage (the viruses that infect bacteria) and a plant.\n\nThe stamen emits the pollen of bloom, a 3-5 foot jet of colored fire, with fast switching between bright red, green, and yellow colors. As toxic bloom fires, it emits a howl from the venturi, a natural cry to its breeding partners as it emits its gametes.",

Three main limbs branch out to form a canopy and support nine steelpans with a four octave range. When the keys of the piano are pressed, solenoids are actuated to strike the pans in the correct location to play the corresponding note. Because some notes overlap between pans, there are a total of 99 solenoids but only 48 notes, which means that some notes will have multiple pans being struck resulting in a rich, complex sound, much like a steelpan orchestra.\n\nAs you approach the piece at night, you will only see the piano by way of a piano lamp which\nilluminates the keyboard, and a piano bench which sits in front of the piano inviting you to\nplay. When a note is played, each striker also has a high intensity white led light that flashes,\nlighting up the branches and pans in a sequence following the notes being played.",

        "description": "WTF??  What the Fork?? consists of two sculptures.  The most prominent is a 16' tall shiny fork, stuck into the ground. It represents the fork in the road, a point of decision and departure.\nStanding in front of the fork is a 10' tall obelisk in the shape of a turning post. Atop the post are motion sensors.  When activated, hands pop up pointing the way to a new direction.\nSpiraling down the obelisk is a plaque which bears the conundrum: \"If you don't know where you're going, any road will get you there.\"  This is synonymous with the seeker who has many roads to choose.  On the Playa there are no roads so the choices are limitless.",

        "description": "\"Your Hug\" is a 10-foot-tall teddy bear sculpture made entirely out of recycled materials by middle school students from Northeast LA. Artist mentors Rebekah Waites and Christine Spehar helped the students bring their ideas to fruition.\n\nThe student who conceptualized the piece is 11-year-old Brisa Cabrera Diaz. Diaz writes in her proposal, “My art piece is of emotion. When you’re sad you hug it and when you’re mad you can talk to it about your madness. Express your feelings to it.”\n\nYour Hug is interactive. When you talk--or sing--to him, he lights up. \n\nYour Hug is a project of RuckusRoots, an LA-based 501c(3) non profit organization.",

A skeleton of an ancient protozoa, a jelly-like plankton creature that once floated in our seas, Zooplankton shows us that science can be the basis of art.  Based on sketches of Cyrotidea drawn in 1904 by German biologist Ernst Haeckel, Zooplankton is an interactive art installation that beckons visitors inside to experience art and science together. By day visitors can enjoy the biological art of Ernst Haeckel etched into the walls of the Zooplankton. Workshops and lectures will turn Zooplankton into a scientific classroom. By night the Zooplankton will charm visitors with its dazzling bioluminescence, triggered by body heat of those who venture inside.",
