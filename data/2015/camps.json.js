A Walk Through Time was initially exhibited in 1997 in the Bay Area and traversed one linear mile. It was a project 20 years in the making. Made anew for Burning Man 2015, the massive endeavor of exhibiting this new 1/4 mile A Walk Through Time is being undertaken to show Burners the reality of how long humans have been on this planet, and how quickly we have changed it in the last 100 years -- a mere nanosecond in the timeline of Earth's history. The intent behind brining this project to Burning Man is to make it one step in the process of ceasing climate change."

Our name “Church of the 5th element” emphasizes that one’s potential can unlocked and amplified when juxtaposing the elements of the external world (earth, wind, fire, and water) with the most powerful element - the individual. The programming that we have created - including climbing structures, fire sculptures, open mic events, a fashion show, and live music -- pushes individuals to examine all aspects of themselves - mind, body, and spirit within the context of the four elements."

Our response is that humans can discover their true nature through yoga and meditation. Self-discovery is a process of lighting up the mythic metaphor of the \"rainbow bridge.\" Anodea Judith writes that \"on our journey through life, the chakras are the wheels along this axis that take the vehicle of the Self along our evolutionary quest, across the Rainbow Bridge, to reclaim our divine nature once again...to restore the Rainbow Bridge is to reconnect to our own divinity, anchoring it in the world around us and healing the rifts that so plague our world.\"\r\n\r\nIn interacting with other burners, we would like to focus on 7 chakras over 7 days. We will offer a daily practice tied to each Chakra leading up to the lotus / crown / diamond chakra the day the man burns."

We took a lot of inspiration from the Book of Tea written in 1906 by Okakura Kakuzō of Japan in English, he addressed the growing concern of clash between the east and west cultures. The struggle he speaks of resonates with the modern cultural issues facing society, the very issues that Burning Man explores."

Feeling naughty? Have a cookie, but at a price (or pleasure). After all of this and you are still feeling blue then visit a Happy Spot. At the end of the day control light with your mind or sit in our sauna dome.\r\n\r\nIs your mind blown? No? Well aren’t you the adventurous soul.

To finish up with the body you might want to have a Cosmic Shower under clouds. Then you are welcome to participate in the Gong Meditation, where each gong is tuned to different planet frequency. Two Gong Masters will activate your cosmic beginning vibes. Also you could join them and make some music with different musical instruments. Afterwards you are welcome to drink Gong Water (Prana water) and leave some gifts by the Altar."
