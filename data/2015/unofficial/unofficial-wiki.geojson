Yet even the most perfect mirror shows only the persona, not the person. This year a funhouse at the center of our carnival will contemplate the puzzle of self-consciousness. Many kinds of masks and mirrors will line the corridors and chambers of this interactive maze. Here people will confront a shuffled deck of selves: the me they want to be (but aren’t), the me they repudiate (but are), the me they can’t imagine (but might be).<br><br>At the heart of this disorienting maze, a final passage will reveal a courtyard that surrounds the Burning Man. Photo booths will here record the faces of participants, merging them into a swirling stream that will envelop the entire body of the Man. The brittle mirror and the occulting mask will melt away, and at this point there’ll be no gag, no swag, no souvenir of self; the show will be you.",

It’s a calming hand, and it’s a listening ear. Nestled in its center is a grove of trees. It’s no tower or pyramid or other such shape dictated by logic alone. It is no less a temple for its lifelike forms. It is more.<br><br>Scattered amidst the flow of the Temple area, wooden sculptures shaped like stones form a soft boundary. The tapering spiral of the main structure provides shelter and quiet. The lobed spire at its opening will tower 97 feet high. The tail of the building curls into a circle around the open-air grove, a container well suited for gatherings. The trees will be bare at the beginning of the week, but participants will leave their messages on strips of white cloth, which they will hang from the trees like the leaves of a weeping willow.                                                     http://www.templeofpromise.org/",

It's noon, and while it's been warm and bright out for a while, you're still waking up, like on a lazy tropical vacation. Keep the illusion alive - stop by the Tropical Treehouse to enjoy pina coladas. Falling in love optional.",

The Tesla Coil will be located on the Playa, just across from the Esplanade. Be mindful of the safety fence around the individual 32’ Tesla towers, but feel welcome to stroll through the Faraday Tunnel and stand at the very center of the action. Who will you meet while standing under 4 million Volts? This system will not have the harsh din of a typical Tesla Coil; expect the rumble of a low Bass note. Pro tip; visit the portos in advance!  Next up: our signature 52’ Tower right on the Esplanade! The Tower will be lit brightly and visible from across the Playa as a distinctive feature of our cityscape.Your journey up the Tower begins with a cozy shaded & lit lounge at Playa level with carpets, bean bags, pillows and blankets. Perfect for a friendly chat, or a full on cuddle puddle! We typically provide coffee table books and a massage table and other basic creature comforts to encourage people to spend time in a friendly and welcoming environment. Rest up and stay as long as you like 24/7.  Next, ascend to Vünderbar, Ze Bar In Ze Sky! The bar floor is 16’ off the Playa, but you may sit 19’ up on our leather stools and rest against the bar. Hang your purse on the hooks and take in the libations! New for 2015: Railings! Lean against the edges without fear of imminent death and look all around. Vünderbar is a place where ten to twenty fellow Burners may gaze out at the beauty of Black Rock City day and night, and meet new friends in an environment similar to an intergalactic departure lounge. That may be the love of your life two stools down; you better say hi! Vünderbar is a 24/7 establishment! That rope ladder isn’t going to climb itself! You will find the very top of the Tower features a 52’ tall Crow’s Nest for up to five people to see Black Rock City in all its glory! This is a great place to take photos. Spend as long as you like and remember, Radical Self Reliance! The Crow’s Nest is open 24/7! Climbing down a Tower is old news. Sextant strongly recommends that you take advantage of the Zip-Line clip-in point 48’ off the Playa (just beneath the Crow’s Nest)! Attach your provided safety harness to the trolley and soar over Black Rock City for 350’, all the way to Arcade Street. Due to the severity of the safety situation, Sextant only operates the Zip-Line if conditions are appropriate.After all this hustle and bustle on the Esplanade, we want to encourage you to explore the neighborhood! What better way to experience the intimacy of the off-Esplanade lifestyle, than to start at the Landing Zone Café at the end of the Zip-Line. You’ll find a laid-back atmosphere with some shade, chairs and bicycle parking (where applicable). Wake up your bartender and ask if they would be so kind as to share a drink with you!<br>Events: <br>Link: https://www.facebook.com/sextantcamp<br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/yhH7tmA.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/hqiWvND.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /><br><br><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34\"><img src=\"http://img.youtube.com/vi/xZzg2YHJi34/hqdefault.jpg\" height=\"200\" width=\"auto\" /></a><br><br><a href=\"https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34\">https://youtube.com/watch?v=xZzg2YHJi34</a>",

        "Description": "First up: Massive Tesla Coils on the Playa! The Tesla Coil will be located on the Playa, just across from the Esplanade. Be mindful of the safety fence around the individual 32’ Tesla towers, but feel welcome to stroll through the Faraday Tunnel and stand at the very center of the action. Who will you meet while standing under 4 million Volts? This system will not have the harsh din of a typical Tesla Coil; expect the rumble of a low Bass note. Pro tip; visit the portos in advance!  Next up: our signature 52’ Tower right on the Esplanade! The Tower will be lit brightly and visible from across the Playa as a distinctive feature of our cityscape.Your journey up the Tower begins with a cozy shaded & lit lounge at Playa level with carpets, bean bags, pillows and blankets. Perfect for a friendly chat, or a full on cuddle puddle! We typically provide coffee table books and a massage table and other basic creature comforts to encourage people to spend time in a friendly and welcoming environment. Rest up and stay as long as you like 24/7.  Next, ascend to Vünderbar, Ze Bar In Ze Sky! The bar floor is 16’ off the Playa, but you may sit 19’ up on our leather stools and rest against the bar. Hang your purse on the hooks and take in the libations! New for 2015: Railings! Lean against the edges without fear of imminent death and look all around.

This year we have 1800+ hand painted commemorative leis to give to citizens that \"do it\" (get naked). Make sure to come by early and get lei'd. We promote a no pressure relaxed atmosphere where you can get naked or not. Nude is not lewd so uninvited touching is prohibited. Come by for a cool drink where you can sit and chat or meet new people. Enjoy our classic rock atmosphere music and a little shade in the heat of the day.

The camps started in 2010 with the original Orphan Endorphin camp, and has now expanded to three camps. The concept behind the Orphanage is that each camp offers a different experience for the virgin and orphan burner. The main Orphan Endorphin camp offers an ‘urban’, loud and busy, experience being located at 7:00 & A in 2015. ORPHANS TOO offers a quieter, less busy, ‘suburban experience. The third camp, Li’l Orphan Annex is in a very quiet, ‘rural’ location, located at 7:15 & H. ORPHANS TOO has a strong ethos of participation and nurturing virgin and orphan burners.  <br>ORPHANS TOO has expanded over the last two years, and now has a significant amount of interactivity. A lot of this interactivity comes from the virgin burners themselves. In 2015 we have 46 virgin burners out of a camp of 72. The ORPHANS TOO team works hard with our virgins to encourage them to work together in the months leading up to the burn to plan a variety of interactivity. One example of this is a group of our virgins this year forming a music and theatre troupe called the “Hard Knocks”. They are planning various events for the week. Another example is the creation of a “Cabinet of Curios” in the theme of the Carnival of Mirrors - again, being planned by a group of our virgin burners. A third example is the suggestion by one of our virgins that we expand the Funky Flower Garden to include Funky Creatures such as insects, lizards and butterflies – and she will be bringing materials to the playa to allow people to create their own on the playa.<br>Events: -THE ASYLUM BAR is an extremely popular suburban bar on the playa. It was located at 7.10 & H in 2014 and was busy throughout the whole week, mainly during the day and up until about midnight. The bar provides high-quality beer and vodkas to the public all week. The bar provides high quality microbrews and ciders from across the US, as well as homebrews from the Orphanage Homebrewers Group. The microbrews for 2015 are : Maui CoConut Porter, Old Guardian Barley Wine, Dogfish Head 90-minute IPA, Victory Golden Monkey, Stone Stochasticity Project Grapefruit Slam IPA, Dirtwolf Double IPA, Angry Orchard Cider and Ace Joker Dry Hard Cider. Home brews will include Hoppy Wheat, Unicorn Blood, Ginger Beer, Hibiscus Saison and White Trash Champagne. There will be a variety of home infused vodkas, some of them smooth and more-ish, others lip-curlingly punchy! <br>-BARON OINK’S LATEX VAC BED & FLOGGING STOOL is scary but kinky. The Vac Bed is a 9 foot high blood red latex envelope, where one or two people can be vacuum sandwiched. Imagine Hans Solo encased in carbonite, but more saucy! The flogging stool is where victims can experience a flogging from a variety of whips, tawse, and floggers (consensual of course). Being encased in latex AND being flogged at the same time is the best experience!<br>-THE FUNKY FLOWER GARDEN is a very simple Art Project concept. But also very effective and interactive. The idea was borne from the close relationship between the ORPHANS TOO camp and the Netherlands burner community. Jason Avery (me) was a member of the Netherlands Burning Man Committee. The idea is that anyone can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to the playa to be enjoyed. Ideally Funky Flowers are lit at night. The flowers can be very simple or extremely bizarre. Usually up to 2 feet high. Anybody can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to ORPHANS TOO. Including people from other camps and the wider Burning Man community. We will even be encouraging burners who are not coming to Burning Man this year to create Funky Flowers and have someone else bring them on their behalf. In 2015, at the suggestion of one of our virgin burners, we shall be expanding the Funky Flower Garden to include Funky Creatures such as spiders, lizards and butterflies.<br>-THE BIG TOP BOUDOIR is the ORPHANS TOO hangout to relax in. Every year we create this relaxing space in the theme of the year. In 2015 it will be in the style of a Big Top Boudoir. Again, the virgins in our camp are working together to design and decorate the space, including carnival mirrors and masks. The Boudoir will be open to the whole of Black Rock City 24 hours per day all week. We regularly have many visitors that use it as a place to relax and reflect. Included within the Big Top Boudoir will be the CABINET OF CURIOS. In the style of the carnival, this will be a cabinet display where people will bring bizarre artifacts either to display, or to gift.<br>-\the HARD KNOCKS is a troupe of musical and theatrical performers. Coincidentally, of our 46 virgin burners, many are musicians and actors. We have therefore formed a troupe of virgin burners who will be putting on various performances throughout the week. There will be live music and live theatre. It is amazing what can be achieved by properly recruiting and encouraging virgin burners!<br>-OTHER PROJECTS. We are also planning other ad-hoc art projects. For example, one of our virgins is making a human-sized Ouija board. And others are making an art project around helium balloons lit at night.  <br>-Finally, the SPUTNIK fire barrel is an ORPHANS TOO institution, having been procured for the camp back in 2011. Together with the Asylum Bar it is a magnet for the citizens of BRC to warm themselves as they are exploring the suburbs.<br>Link: http://orphanendorphin.com",

Being encased in latex AND being flogged at the same time is the best experience!\n-THE FUNKY FLOWER GARDEN is a very simple Art Project concept. But also very effective and interactive. The idea was borne from the close relationship between the ORPHANS TOO camp and the Netherlands burner community. Jason Avery (me) was a member of the Netherlands Burning Man Committee. The idea is that anyone can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to the playa to be enjoyed. Ideally Funky Flowers are lit at night. The flowers can be very simple or extremely bizarre. Usually up to 2 feet high. Anybody can design and create a Funky Flower and bring it to ORPHANS TOO. Including people from other camps and the wider Burning Man community. We will even be encouraging burners who are not coming to Burning Man this year to create Funky Flowers and have someone else bring them on their behalf. In 2015, at the suggestion of one of our virgin burners, we shall be expanding the Funky Flower Garden to include Funky Creatures such as spiders, lizards and butterflies.\n-THE BIG TOP BOUDOIR is the ORPHANS TOO hangout to relax in. Every year we create this relaxing space in the theme of the year. In 2015 it will be in the style of a Big Top Boudoir. Again, the virgins in our camp are working together to design and decorate the space, including carnival mirrors and masks. The Boudoir will be open to the whole of Black Rock City 24 hours per day all week. We regularly have many visitors that use it as a place to relax and reflect. Included within the Big Top Boudoir will be the CABINET OF CURIOS. In the style of the carnival, this will be a cabinet display where people will bring bizarre artifacts either to display, or to gift.\n-\the HARD KNOCKS is a troupe of musical and theatrical performers. Coincidentally, of our 46 virgin burners, many are musicians and actors. We have therefore formed a troupe of virgin burners who will be putting on various performances throughout the week. There will be live music and live theatre. It is amazing what can be achieved by properly recruiting and encouraging virgin burners!\n-OTHER PROJECTS. We are also planning other ad-hoc art projects. For example, one of our virgins is making a human-sized Ouija board. And others are making an art project around helium balloons lit at night.  \n-Finally, the SPUTNIK fire barrel is an ORPHANS TOO institution, having been procured for the camp back in 2011. Together with the Asylum Bar it is a magnet for the citizens of BRC to warm themselves as they are exploring the suburbs.",

Hashing is a little game we like to play. In a nutshell, Hashers like to call themselves a drinking group with a running problem. We run and frolic, stopping to enjoy a cold beverage and sing a song or two. Based on the child’s game, hare and hound, hashing requires a “hare” to mastermind and set a running trail. With a small head start, the “hare” lays a trail using flour (on the playa we use survey flags that are swept after trail is complete) with a group of “hounds” leaving shortly after with the goal of catching the hare.

Known for their custom of innovation and creativity, craft breweries are small, independent operations which endeavor to think outside the box of traditional beer marketing to create memorable and delicious beers.The Canadian Cascadian Tiki Lounge's mission is to bring and share the fruits of these labors to the dusty, arid playa, quenching the thirst of curious burners who wish to know more about this tasty tradition by offering tastings of specific types of beers daily. Our Ciceron-in-training, Nicole, will share her knowledge of the methods used to craft these beers, the types of foods best paired with them as well their history from their inception in wooden casks in the UK to the modern day beverage enjoyed everywhere today.Burners will be encouraged to sample each beer as they are discussed and participate in a Q&A about the style of each beer as well as the various hops and the flavors they bring to each brew.

There are interactive games to enjoy while waiting for coffee. We have additional scheduled activities including a return of our very popular Beard Spa and a night-time flagging (silk poi) workshop under black lights. Pearler beading and stilt walking are returning this year. Other possibilities are still being considered as our creative camp participants finalize plans for 2015. ",

This year, we will have interactive classes teaching burners about science that can be used to create art, as well as art that makes science real. We strive to balance the left/right brain dichotomy with a range of activities to meet our fellow Burners’ diverse tastes.We will be providing a wide range of activities on the playa. This year we are able to add night time activities in addition to our day time events. Some activities include:· Bismuth crystal making · Triple pendulums, separate Night and Day versions! See the prototype here! http://www.flickr.com/photos/mrscience/8654430636 · Harmonograph · Measurement of the earth’s procession · GPS trackering – wondering where you were last night? · Pneumatic can crusher- hours of fun creating ammo · Tasty beverage density columns · A veritable crap-ton of optical gadgets and more! We will have a complete listing in Who/What/Where plus a reader board in camp with details of the subjects and times. The list above are the activities we already have planned and built (where building is required). In addition to our daily activities, we generally strive to have a few impromptu events, such as last year’s Bacon and Socks on Thursday morning. Frankly, we were surprised how many people on the playa needed socks, and it was yet another opportunity to meet new people.The Bad Idea Bar will continue to operate throughout the week providing refreshing beverages upon request. Give us a bad idea and we’ll give you a bad drink. Bad ideas are listed and derogatory comments made throughout the week. At the end we have the community choose the best of the worst ideas, then celebrate the winners and losers with more bad drinks.

We are happy to share our view as it gives us a chance to learn a little more about you. Finally, and most important during the day, you want shade? We’ve got shade. Over 800 square feet of cool goodness with comfy seating and a filled ice jug are always available.

Pillows, beanbags, and cushions cover the floor, with couches on the perimeter, facing in. For the night, there are ample blankets and chill party lights overhead. In the back, a modest sound system to provide Temple’s inhabitants with music, should it somehow not be coming from elsewhere. The custom made dome cover can be raised so that those who are lounging may interact with those who are on the street, or it may be lowered to protect against dust and wind. We hope to provide a space where people can relax and be comfortable together, within the Fluff. We wish to create an environment in which, if you see interesting people on the other side of the Fluff, you never have to stop being comfortable as you roll your way over to them.
